  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The present volume is intended as a handbook for investigators and for
advanced students of ecology, and not as a text-book of the subject. An
elementary text-book covering the same field, but adapted to the needs of
undergraduate students, is in preparation. The handbook is essentially an
account of the methods used by the author in his studies of the last eight
years, during which a serious attempt has been made to discover and to
correlate the fundamental points of view in the vast field of vegetation.
No endeavor is made to treat any portion of the subject exhaustively, since
a discussion of general methods and general principles is of much greater
value in the present condition of ecology. The somewhat unequal treatment
given the different subjects is due to the fact that it has been found
possible to develop some of these more rapidly than others. Finally, it must
be constantly kept in mind that ecology is still in a very plastic condition,
and in consequence, methods, fundamental principles, and matters of nomenclature
and terminology must be approached without prejudice in order that
the best possible development of this field may be attained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grateful acknowledgment for criticisms and suggestions is made to Professor
Doctor Charles E. Bessey and Professor Doctor Roscoe Pound, who
have read the text. The author is under especial obligations to Doctor Edith
S. Clements for the drawings of leaf types, as well as for reading and criticising
the manuscript. Professor Goodwin D. Swezey, Professor of Astronomy
in the University of Nebraska, has kindly furnished much material
for the determination of the sun’s altitude, and consequent light intensities,
and has read the section devoted to light. Mr. George A. Loveland, Director
of the Nebraska Section of the U. S. Weather Bureau, has contributed
many helpful suggestions to the discussion of meteorological instruments.
To Nella Schlesinger, Alice Venters, and George L. Fawcett, advanced students
in experimental ecology, the author is indebted for many experiments
which have been used in the discussion of adjustment and adaptation.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><b>1. The scope of ecology.</b> The clue to the field of ecology is found in
the Greek word, οἲκος, home. The point of view in the following treatise
is constantly that which is inherent in the term itself. Ecology is therefore
considered the dominant theme in the study of plants, indeed, as the central
and vital part of botany. This statement may at first appear startling, if
not unfounded, but mature reflection will show that all the questions of
botanical science lead sooner or later to the two ultimate facts: plant and
habitat. The essential truth of this has been much obscured by detached
methods of study in physiology, morphology, and histology, which are too
often treated as independent fields. These have suffered incomplete and
unsymmetric development in consequence of extreme specialistic tendencies.
Analytic methods have dominated research to the exclusion of synthetic
ones, which, in a greatly diversified field, must be final, if botanical knowledge
is something to be systematized and not merely catalogued. Physiology
in particular has suffered at the hands of detached specialists. Originally
conceived as an inquiry into the origin and nature of plants, it has
been developed strictly as a study of plant activities. It all but ignores the
physical factors that control function, and the organs and tissues that
reflect it.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>2. Ecology and physiology.</b> There can be little question in regard to the
essential identity of physiology and ecology. This is evident when it is
clearly seen that the present difference between the two fields is superficial.
Ecology has been largely the descriptive study of vegetation; physiology
has concerned itself with function; but, when carefully analyzed, both are
seen to rest upon the same foundation. In each, the development is incomplete:
ecology has so far been merely superficial, physiology too highly specialized.
The one is chaotic and unsystematized, the other too often a
minute study of function under abnormal circumstances. The greatest need
of the former is the introduction of method and system, of the latter, a
broadening of scope and new objectives. The growing recognition of the
identity of the two makes it desirable to anticipate their final merging, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>to formulate a system that will combine the good in each, and at the same
time eliminate superficial and extreme tendencies. In this connection, it
becomes necessary to point out to ecologist and physiologist alike that,
while they have been working on the confines of the same great field, each
must familiarize himself with the work and methods of the other, before his
preparation is complete. Both must broaden their horizons, and rearrange
their views. The ecologist is sadly in need of the more intimate and exact
methods of the physiologist: the latter must take his experiments into the
field, and must recognize more fully that function is but the middleman between
habitat and plant. It seems probable that the final name for the whole
field will be physiology, although the term ecology has distinct advantages
of brevity and of meaning. In this event, however, it should be clearly
recognized that, although the name remains the same, the field has become
greatly broadened by new viewpoints and new methods.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>3. Geographical distribution.</b> The systematic analysis of the great field
of ecology is essential to its proper development in the future. A glance
at its history shows that, while a number of essential points of attack have
been discovered, only one or two of these have been organized, and that
there is still an almost entire lack of correlation and coordination between
these. The earliest and simplest development of the subject was concerned
with the distribution of plants. This was at first merely an offshoot of
taxonomy, and, in spite of the work of Humboldt and Schouw, has persisted
in much of its primitive form to the present time, where it is represented
by innumerable lists and catalogues. Geographical distribution was
grounded upon the species, a fact which early caused it to become stereotyped
as a statistical study of little value. This tendency was emphasized
by the general practice of determining distribution for more or less artificial
areas, and of instituting comparisons between regions or continents
too little known or too widely remote. The fixed character of the subject
is conclusively shown by the fact that it still persists in almost the original
form more than a half century after Grisebach pointed out that the formation
was the real unit of vegetation, and hence of distribution.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>4. The plant formation.</b> The corner-stone of ecology was laid by Grisebach
in 1838 by his recognition of the plant formation as the fundamental
feature of vegetation. Earlier writers, notably Linné (1737, 1751), Biberg
(1749), and Hedenberg (1754), had perceived this relation more or less
clearly, but failed to reduce it to a definite guiding principle. This was a
natural result of the dominance of descriptive botany in the 18th century,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>by virtue of which all other lines of botanical inquiry languished. This
tendency had spent itself to a certain degree by the opening of the 19th
century, and both plant distribution and plant physiology began to take
form. The stimulus given the former by Humboldt (1807) turned the
attention of botanists more critically to the study of vegetation as a field
in itself, and the growing feeling for structure in the latter led to Grisebach’s
concept of the formation, which he defined as follows: “I would
term a group of plants which bears a definite physiognomic character, such
as a meadow, a forest, etc., a phytogeographic formation. The latter may
be characterized by a single social species, by a complex of dominant species
belonging to one family, or, finally, it may show an aggregate of species,
which, though of various taxonomic character, have a common peculiarity;
thus, the alpine meadows consist almost exclusively of perennial herbs.”
The acceptance of the formation as the unit of vegetation took place slowly,
but as a result of the work of Kerner (1863), Grisebach (1872), Engler
(1879), Hult (1881, 1885), Goeze (1882), Beck (1884), Drude (1889),
and Warming (1889), this point of view came to be more and more prevalent.
It was not, however, until the appearance of three works of great
importance, Warming (1895), Drude (1896), and Schimper (1898), that
the concept of the formation became generally predominant. With the
growing recognition of the formation during the last decade has appeared
the inevitable tendency to stereotype the subject of ecology in this stage.
The present need, in consequence, is to show very clearly that the idea of
the formation is a fundamental, and not an ultimate one, and that the proper
superstructure of ecology is yet to be reared upon this as the foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>5. Plant succession.</b> The fact that formations arise and disappear was
perceived by Biberg as early as 1749, but it received slight attention until
Steenstrup’s study of the succession in the forests of Zealand (1844 prox.).
In the development of formations, as well as in their recognition, nearly all
workers have confined themselves to the investigation of particular changes.
Berg (1844), Vaupell (1851), Hoffmann (1856), Middendorff (1864),
Hult (1881), Senft (1888), Warming (1890), and others have added much
to our detailed knowledge of formational development. Notwithstanding
the lapse of more than a half century, the study of plant successions is by
no means a general practice among ecologists. This is a ready explanation
of the fact that the vast field has so far yielded but few generalizations.
Warming (1895) was the first to compile the few general principles of development
clearly indicated up to this time. The first critical attempt to
systematize the investigation of succession was made by Clements (1904),
though this can be considered as little more than a beginning on account of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the small number of successions so far studied. Future progress in this
field will be conditioned not only by the more frequent study of developmental
problems by working ecologists, but also, and most especially, by
the application of known principles of succession, and by the working out
of new ones.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>6. Ecological phytogeography.</b> Until recent years, the almost universal
tendency was to give attention to formations from the standpoint of vegetation
alone. While the habitat was touched here and there by isolated workers,
and plant functions were being studied intensively by physiologists,
both were practically ignored by ecologists as a class. The appearance of
Warming’s <i><span lang="de">Lehrbuch der oecologischen Pflanzengeographie</span></i> (1896) and of
Schimper’s <i><span lang="de">Pflanzengeographie auf physiologischer Grundlage</span></i> (1898) remedied
this condition in a measure by a general discussion of the habitat, and by
emphasizing the importance of the ecological or physiological point of view.
Despite their frank recognition of the unique value of the habitat, the major
part of both books was necessarily given to what may be termed the general
description of formations. For this reason, and for others arising out of
an almost complete dearth of methods of investigation, ecology is still almost
entirely a floristic study in practice, although there is a universal recognition
of the much greater value of the viewpoint which rests upon the
relation between the formation and its habitat.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>7. Experimental ecology.</b> Properly speaking, the experimental study of
ecology dates from Bonnier<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> (1890, 1895), though it is well understood that
experimental adjustment of plants to certain physical factors had been the
subject of investigation before this time. The chief merit of Bonnier’s
work, however, lies in the fact that it was done out of doors, under natural
conditions, and for these reasons it should be regarded as the real beginning
of this subject. Bonnier’s experiments were made for the purpose of
determining the effect of altitude. Culture plots of certain species were
located in the Alps and the Pyrenees, and the results were compared with
control cultures made in the lowlands about Paris. In 1894 he also made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>a comparative study of certain polydemic species common to the arctic
islands, Jan Meyen and Spitzenberg, and to the Alps. Both of these methods
are fundamental to field experiment, but the results are inconclusive,
inasmuch as altitude is a complex of factors. As no careful study was
made of the latter, it was manifestly impossible to refer changes and differences
of structure to the definite cause. In a paper that has just appeared,
E. S. Clements (1905) has applied the method of polydemic comparison
to nearly a hundred species of the Rocky mountains. In this work,
the all-important advance has been made of determining accurately the decisive
differences between the two or more habitats of the same species in
terms of direct factors, water-content, humidity, and light. In his own
investigations of Colorado mountain vegetation, the author has applied the
method of field cultures by planting seeds of somewhat plastic species in
habitats of measured value, and has thought to initiate a new line of research
by applying experimental methods to the study of vegetation as an
organism. In connection with this, there has also been developed a method
of control experiment in the plant house under definitely measured differences
of water and light.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>8. Ecology of the habitat.</b> Since the time of Humboldt, there have been
desultory attempts to determine the physical factors of habitats with some
degree of accuracy. The first real achievement in this line was in the
measurement of light values by Wiesner in 1896. In 1898 the writer first
began to study the structure of habitats by the determination of water-content,
light, humidity, temperature, wind, etc., by means of instruments.
These methods were used by one of his pupils, Thornber (1901), in the
study of a particular formation, and by another, Hedgcock (1902), in a
critical investigation of water-content. Two years later, similar methods
of measuring physical factors were put into operation in connection with
experimental evolution under control in the plant house. E. S. Clements
(1905), as already indicated, has made the use of factor instruments the
foundation of a detailed study of polydemic species, i. e., those which grow
in two or more habitats, and which are, indeed, the most perfect of all experiments
in the production of new forms. In a volume in preparation
upon the mountain vegetation of Colorado, the writer has brought the use
of physical factor instruments to a logical conclusion, and has made the
study of the habitat the basis of the whole work. Out of this investigation
has come a new concept of vegetation (Clements 1904), namely, that it is
to be regarded as a complex organism with structures and with functions
susceptible of exact methods of study.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span><b>9. The evidence from historical development.</b> This extremely brief
resume of what has been accomplished in the several lines of ecological
research makes evident the almost complete absence of correlation and of
system. The whole field not merely lacks system, but it also demands a
much keener perception of the relative value of the different tendencies
already developed. It is inevitable from the great number of tyros, and
of dilettante students of ecology in comparison with the few specialists, that
the surface of the field should have received all of the attention. It is,
however, both unfortunate and unscientific that great lines of development
should be entirely unknown to all but a few. There is no other department
of botany in which the superficial study of more than half a century ago
still prevails to the exclusion of better methods, many of which have been
known for a decade or more. It is clear, then, that the imperative need of
ecology is the proper coordination of its various points of view, and the
working out of a definite system which will make possible a ready recognition
of that which is fundamental and of that which is merely collateral.
The historical development, as is well understood, can furnish but a slight
clue to this. It is a fact of common knowledge that the first development
of any subject is general, and usually superficial also. True values come
out clearly only after the whole field has been surveyed. For these reasons,
as will be pointed out in detail later, the newer viewpoints are regarded as
either the most important or the most fundamental. Experimental ecology
will throw a flood of light upon plant structure and function, while exact
methods of studying the habitat are practically certain of universal application
in the future.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>PRESENT STATUS OF ECOLOGY</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>10. The lack of special training.</b> The bane of the recent development
popularly known as ecology has been a widespread feeling that anyone can
do ecological work, regardless of preparation. There is nothing in modern
botany more erroneous than this feeling. The whole task of ecology is to
find out what the living plant and the living formation are doing and have
done in response to definite complexes of factors, i. e., habitats. In this
sense, ecology is practically coextensive with botany, and the student of a
local flora who knows a few hundred species is no more competent to do
ecological work than he is to reconstruct the phylogeny of the vegetable
kingdom, or to explain the transmission of ancestral qualities. The comprehensive
and fundamental character of the subject makes a broad special
training even more requisite than in more restricted lines of botanical inquiry.
The ecologist must first of all be a botanist, not a mere cataloguer
of plants, and he must also possess a particular training in the special methods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>of ecological research. He must be familiar with the various points of
attack in this field, and he must know the history of his subject thoroughly.
Ecology affords the most striking example of the prevalent evil of American
botanical study, i. e., an indifference to, or an ignorance of the literature
of the subject. The trouble is much aggravated here, however, by the
breadth of the field, and the common assumption that a special training is
unnecessary, if not, indeed, superfluous. Ignorance of the important ecological
literature has been a most fertile source of crude and superficial
studies, a condition that will become more apparent as these fields are
worked again by carefully trained investigators.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>11. Descriptive ecology.</b> The stage of development of the subject at the
present time may be designated as <em>descriptive ecology</em>, for purposes of discussion
merely. This is concerned with the superficial description of vegetation
in general terms, and results from the fact that the development has
begun on the surface, and has scarcely penetrated beneath it. The organic
connection between ecology and floristic has produced an erroneous impression
as to the relative value of the two. Floristic has required little knowledge,
and less preparation: it lends itself with insidious ease to chance journeys
or to vacation trips, the fruits of which are found in vague descriptive
articles, and in the multiplication of fictitious formations. While there is
good reason that a record should be left of any serious reconnaissance, even
though it be of a few weeks’ duration, the resulting lists and descriptive
articles can have only the most rudimentary value, and it is absurd to regard
them as ecological contributions at all. No statement admits of stronger
emphasis, and there is none that should be taken more closely to heart by
botanists who have supposed that they were doing ecological work. An
almost equally fertile source of valueless work is the independent treatment
of a restricted local area. The great readiness with which floristic lists
and descriptions can be made has led many a botanist, working in a small
area, or passing hurriedly through an extended region, to try his hand at
formation making. From this practice have resulted scores of so-called
formations, which are mere patches, consocies, or stages in development,
or which have, indeed, no existence other than in the minds of their discoverers.
The misleading definiteness which a photograph seems to give
a bit of vegetation has been responsible for a surplus of photographic formations,
which have no counterparts in nature. Indispensable as the photograph
is to any systematic record of vegetation, its use up to the present
time has but too often served to bring it into disrepute. There has been a
marked tendency to apply the current methods of descriptive botany to
vegetation, and to regard every slightly different piece of the floral covering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>as a formation. No method can yield results further from the truth. It is
evident that the recognition and limitation of formations should be left absolutely
to the broadly trained specialist, who has a thorough preparation by
virtue of having acquainted himself carefully with the development and
structure of typical formations over large areas.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>12. The value of floristic.</b> In what has been said above, there is no intent
to decry the value of floristic. The skilled workman can spare the
material which he is fashioning as readily as the ecologist can work without
an accurate knowledge of the genera and species which make up a particular
vegetation. Some botanists whose knowledge of ecology is that of the study
or the laboratory have maintained that it is possible to investigate vegetation
without knowing the plants which compose it. Ecology is to be
wrought out in the field, however, and the field ecologist—none other, indeed,
should bear the name—understands that floristic alone can furnish
the crude material which takes form under his hands. It is the absolute
need of a thorough acquaintance with the flora of a region which makes it
impossible for a traveler to obtain anything of real ecological value in his
first journey through a country. As the very first step, he must gain at
least a fair knowledge of the floristic, which will alone take the major part
of one or more growing seasons. This information the student of a local
flora already has at the tip of his tongue; in itself it can not constitute a
contribution to ecology, but merely the basis for one. In this connection,
moreover, it can not be used independently, but becomes of value only after
an acquaintance with a wide field. Floristic study and floristic lists, then,
are indispensable, but to be of real value their proper function must be
clearly recognized. They do not constitute ecology.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>13. Reconnaissance and investigation.</b> In striving to indicate the true
value and worth of ecological study, it becomes necessary to draw a definite
line between what we may term <em>reconnaissance</em> and <em>investigation</em>. By the
former is understood the preliminary survey of a region, extending over
one or two years. The objects of such a survey are to obtain a comprehensive
general knowledge of the topography and vegetation of the region,
and of its relation to the other regions about it. The chief purpose, however,
is to gain a good working acquaintance with the flora: a reconnaissance
to be of value must do this at all events. Certain general facts will
inevitably appear during this process, but they will invariably need the confirmation
of future study. It would be an advantage to real ecology if
reconnaissance were to confine itself entirely to the matter of making a
careful floristic survey. Investigation begins when the inquiry is directed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>to the habitat, or to the development and structure of the formation which
it bears, i. e., when it takes up the manifold problems of the οἶκος. Such
a study must be based upon floristic, but the latter becomes a part of investigation
only in so far as it leads to it. Standing by itself, it is not
ecological research: it is the preparation for it. This distinction deserves
careful thought. The numerous recruits to ecology have turned their attention
to what lay nearest to hand, with little question as to its value, or to
where it might lead. The result has been to make reconnaissance far outweigh
investigation in amount, and to give it a value which properly belongs
to the latter. Furthermore, this mistaken conception has in many
cases, without doubt, prevented its leading to valuable research work.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>14. Resident investigation.</b> Obviously, if reconnaissance is a superficial
survey, and investigation thorough extensive study, an important distinction
between them is in the time required. While one may well be the result of
a journey of some duration, the other is essentially dependent upon residence.
In the past the great disparity between the size of the field and the
number of workers has made resident study too often an ideal, but in the
future it will be increasingly the case that a particular region will be worked
by a trained ecologist resident in it. This may never be altogether true of
inaccessible and sterile portions of the globe. It may be pointed out, however,
that, between the tropics and the poles, residence during the summer
or growing period is in essence continuous residence. In the ultimate analysis,
winter conditions have of course some influence upon the development
of vegetation during the summer, but the important problems which a
vegetation presents must be worked out during the period of development.
For temperate, arctic, and alpine regions, then, repeated study during the
growing period for a term of years has practically all the advantages of
continuous residence. For all practical purposes, it is resident study.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>15. The dangers of a restricted field.</b> In the resident study of a particular
region, the temptation to make an intensive investigation of a circumscribed
area is very strong. The limits imposed by distance are alone
a sufficient explanation of this, but it is greatly increased by the inclination
toward detailed study for which a small field offers opportunity. This
temptation can be overcome only by a general preliminary study of the
larger region in which the particular field is located. The broader outlook
gained in this way will throw needed light upon many obscure facts of the
latter, and at the same time it will act as a necessary corrective of the tendency
to consider the problems of the local field in a detached manner, and
to magnify the value of the distinctions made and the results obtained.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Such a general survey has the purpose and value of a reconnaissance, and
is always the first step in the accurate and detailed investigation of the
local area or formation. Each corrects the extreme tendency of the other,
and thorough comprehensive work can be done only by combining the two
methods. When the field of inquiry is a large area or covers a whole region,
the procedure should be essentially the same. A third stage must be
added, however, in which a more careful survey is made of the entire field
in the light of the thorough study of the local area. The writer’s methods
in the investigation of the Colorado vegetation illustrate this procedure.
The summers of 1896, 1897, 1898 were devoted to reconnaissance; those of
1899–1904 were given to detailed and comprehensive study by instrument
and quadrat of a highly diversified, representative area less than 20 miles
square, while the work of the final summer will be the application of the
results obtained in this localized area to the region traversed from 1896–98.
This is practically the application of methods of precision to an area of more
than 100,000 square miles. It also serves to call attention to another point
not properly appreciated as yet by those who would do ecological work.
This is the need of taking up field problems as a result of serious forethought,
and not as a matter of accident or mere propinquity. A carefully
matured plan of attack which contemplates an expenditure of time and
energy for a number of years will yield results of value, no matter how
much attention an area may have received. On the other hand, an aimless
or hurried excursion into the least known or richest of regions will lead to
nothing but a waste of time, especially upon the part of the ecologist, who
must read the articles which result, if only for the purpose of making sure
that there is nothing in them.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>APPLICATIONS OF ECOLOGY</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>16. The subjects touched by ecology.</b> The applications of ecological
methods and results to other departments of botany, and to other fields of
research are numerous. Many of these are both intimate and fundamental,
and give promise of affording new and extremely fruitful points of view.
It has already been indicated that ecology bears the closest of relations to
morphology and histology on the one side, and to physiology on the other—that
it is, indeed, nothing but a rational field physiology, which regards
form and function as inseparable phenomena. The closeness with which it
touches plant pathology follows directly from this, as pathology is nothing
more than abnormal form and functioning. Experimental work in ecology
is purely a study of <em>evolution</em>, and the facts of the latter are the materials
with which <em>taxonomy</em> deals. <em>Forestry</em> has already been termed “applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>ecology” and in its scientific aspects, which are its foundation, it is precisely
the ecology of woody plants, and of the vegetation which they constitute.
Apart from botany, the physical side of ecology is largely a question of <em>soil
physics</em>, and of <em>physiography</em>. On the other hand, vegetation is coming
more and more to be regarded as a fundamental factor in <em>zoogeography</em>
and in <em>sociology</em>. Furthermore, with respect to the latter, it will be pointed
out below that the principles of association which have been determined for
plants, viz., invasion, succession, zonation, and alternation, apply with almost
equal force to man.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>17. Physiology and pathology.</b> The effect of ecology in emphasizing the
intrinsically close connection between physiology and morphology has already
been mentioned. Its influence in normalizing the former by forcing
it into the field as the place for experiment, and by directing the chief attention
to the plant as an organism rather than a complex of organs, is also
rapidly coming to be felt. Ecology will doubtless exert a corrective influence
upon pathology in the near future. This is inevitable as the latter
ceases to be the merely formal study of specific pathogenic organisms, and
turns its attention to the cause of all abnormality, which is to be found in
the habitat, whether this be physical, as when the water-content is low, or
biotic, when a parasitic fungus is present. The relative ease with which
specific diseases can be studied has helped to obscure the essential fact that
the approach to pathology must be through physiology. Much indeed of
the observational physiology of the laboratories has been pathology, and it
will be impossible to draw a clear line between them until precise experiment
in the habitat has come into vogue.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>18. Experimental evolution.</b> As a result of the extremely fragmentary
character of the geological record, nothing is more absolute than that there
can be no positive knowledge of the exact origin of a form or species, except
in those rare cases of the present day, where the whole process has
taken place under the eye of a trained observer. The origin of the plant
forms known at present must forever lie without the domain of direct knowledge.
If it were possible, by a marvel of ingenuity and patience to develop
experimentally <em>Myosurus</em> from <em>Selaginella</em>, this would not be absolutely
conclusive proof that <em>Myosurus</em> was first derived in this way. When all
is said, however, this would be the very best of presumptive evidence. It
must also be recognized that this is the nearest to complete proof that we
shall ever attain, and with this in mind it becomes apparent at once that
evidence from experiment is of paramount importance in the study of evolution
(the origin of species).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The phase of experimental ecology which has to do with the plant has
well been called experimental evolution. While this is a field almost wholly
without development at present, there can be little question that it is to be
one of the most fertile and important in the future. Attention will be directed
first to those forms which are undergoing modification at the present
time. The cause and direction of change will be ascertained, and its amount
and rapidity measured by biometrical methods. The next step will be to
actually change the habitat of representative types, and to determine for
each the general trend of adaptation, as well as the exact details. By means
of the methods used and the results obtained in these investigations, it will
be possible to attack the much more difficult problem of retracing the development
of species already definitely constituted. This will be accomplished
by the study of the derived and the supposed ancestral form, but owing to
the great preponderance of evolution over reversion, the study of the ancestral
form will yield much more valuable results.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general application of the methods of experimental ecology will mark
a new era in the study of evolution. There has been a surplus of literary
investigation, but altogether too little actual experiment. The great value
of De Vries’ work lies not in the importance of the results obtained, but in
calling attention to the unique importance of experimental methods in contributing
to a knowledge of evolution. The development of the latter has
been greatly hindered by the dearth of actual facts, and by a marked tendency
to compensate for this by verbiage and dogmatism. This is well illustrated
by the present position of the “mutation theory,” which, so far as the
evidence available is concerned, is merely a working hypothesis. An incredible
amount of bias and looseness of thought have characterized the
discussion of evolution. It is earnestly to be hoped that the future will
bring more work and less argument, and that the literary evolutionists will
become less and less reluctant to leave the relative merits of variation and
mutation to experiment.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>19. Taxonomy.</b> Taxonomy is classified evolution. It is distinct from
descriptive botany, which is merely a cataloguing of all known forms, with
little regard to development and relationship. The consideration of the latter
is peculiarly the problem of taxonomy, but the solution must be sought
through experimental evolution. The first task of the latter is to determine
the course of modification in related forms, and the relationships existing
between them. With this information, taxonomy can group forms according
to their rank, i. e., their descent. The same method is applicable to the
species of a genus, and, in a less degree, perhaps, to the genera which constitute
a family. The use to which it may be put in indicating family relationships
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>will depend largely upon the gap existing between the families
concerned. While interpretation will always play a part in taxonomy, the
general use of experiment will leave much less opportunity for the personal
equation than is at present the case. Taxonomy, like descriptive botany, is
based upon the species, but, while there may exist a passable kind of descriptive
botany, there can be no real taxonomy as long as the sole criterion
of a species is the difference which any observer thinks he sees between one
plant and another. The so-called species of to-day range in value from
mere variations to true species which are groups of great constancy and
definiteness. The reasons for this are obvious when one recalls that “species”
are still the product of the herbarium, not of the field, and that the
more intensive the study, the greater the output in “species.” It would
seem that careful field study of a form for several seasons would be the
first requisite for the making of a species, but it is a precaution which is
entirely ignored in the vast majority of cases. The thought of subjecting
forms presumed to be species to conclusive test by experiment has apparently
not even occurred to descriptive botanists as yet. Notwithstanding,
there can be no serious doubt that the existing practice of re-splitting hairs
must come to an end sooner or later. The remedy will come from without
through the application of experimental methods in the hands of the ecologist,
and the cataloguing of slight and unrelated differences will yield to
an ordered taxonomy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Experimental evolution will solve a taxonomic problem as yet untouched,
namely, the effect of recent environment upon the production of species. It
is well understood that some species grow in nature in various habitats
without suffering material change, while others are modified to constitute a
new form in each habitat. It is at once clear that these forms (or ecads)
are of more recent descent than the species, i. e., of lower rank. It must
also be recognized that a constant group and a highly plastic one are essentially
different. If constancy is made a necessary quality of a species, one
is a species, the other is not. If both are species, then two different kinds
must be distinguished. Among the species of our manuals are found many
ecads, alongside of constant and inconstant species. These can be distinguished
only by field experiment, and their proper coordination is possible
only after this has been done. Indeed, the whole question of the ability or
the inability of environmental variation to produce constant species is one
that must be referred to repeated and long-continued experiment in the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>A minor service of considerable value can be rendered taxonomy by
working over the diagnosis from the ecological standpoint. Many ecological
facts are of real diagnostic value, while others are at least of much interest,
and serve to direct attention to the plant as a living thing. The loose use of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>terms denoting abundance, which prevails in lists and manuals, should be
replaced by the exact usage which the quadrat method has made possible
for vegetation. The designation of habitats could be made much more
exact, and the formation, as well as the habitat form or ecad, and the vegetation form
or phyad, should be indicated in addition. The general terms
drawn from pollination, seed-production, and dissemination might also be
included to advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>20. Forestry</b>, if the purely commercial aspects be disregarded, is the
ecology of a particular kind of vegetation, the forest. Therefore, in pointing
out the connection between them, it is only necessary to say that whatever
contributes to the ecology of the forest is a contribution to forestry.
There are, however, certain lines of inquiry which are of fundamental importance.
First among these, and of primary interest from the practical
point of view, are the questions pertaining to the distribution of forests and
their structure. Of even greater significance are the problems of forest
development, movement, and of reforestation, which are comprised in
succession. The gradual invasion of the plains and prairies by the forest
belt of the east and north is in full conformity with the laws of invasion,
and the ecological methods to be employed here serve not merely to determine
the actual conditions at present, but also to forecast them with a
great deal of accuracy. The slow but certain development of forests on new
soils, and their more rapid reestablishment where the woody vegetation has
been destroyed by burning or lumbering, are ordinary phenomena of succession,
for which the ecologist has already worked out the laws, and determined
the methods of investigation. Having once ascertained the original
and adjacent vegetation and the character of the habitat, the ecologist can
indicate with accuracy not only the character of the new forest that will
appear, but also the nature of the antecedent formations. A full knowledge
of the character and laws of succession will prove of the greatest value to
the forester in all studies of forestation and reforestation. Forests which
now seem entirely unrelated will be seen to possess the most intimate developmental
connection, and the fuller insight into the life history gained in
this way will have a direct bearing upon methods of conservation, etc. It
will further show that the forester must know other vegetations as well,
since grassland and thicket formations have an intimate influence upon the
course of the succession, as well as upon the advance of a forest frontier.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the greatest aids which modern ecology can furnish forestry,
however, is the method of determining the physical nature of the habitat.
So far, foresters have been obliged to content themselves with a more or
less superficial study of the structure of forest formations, without being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>able to do more than guess at the physical causes which control both structure
and development. This handicap is especially noticeable in the case of
forest plantings in non-forested regions, where it has been impossible to
estimate the chances of success, or to determine the most favorable areas
except by actual plantations. Equipped with the proper instruments for
measuring water-content, humidity, light and temperature, the ecologist is
able to determine the precise conditions under which reproduction is occurring,
and to ascertain what non-forested areas offer the most nearly similar
conditions. A knowledge of habitats and the means of measuring them
enables the forester to discover the causes which control the vegetation with
which he is already familiar, and to forecast results otherwise hidden. Furthermore,
it makes it possible for him to enter a new region and to determine
its nature and capabilities at a minimum of time and energy.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>21. Physiography.</b> Physiographic features play an important part in determining
the quantity of certain direct factors of the habitat. Perhaps a
more important connection between physiography and ecology is to be found
in succession. The beginning of all primary, and of many secondary successions
is to be sought in the physiographic processes which produce new
habitats, or modify old ones. On the other hand, most of the reactions which
continue successions exert a direct influence upon the form of the land.
The most pronounced influence of terrestrial successions is found in the
stabilization which their ultimate stages exert upon land forms, even where
these are highly immature. The chief effect of aquatic successions is to be
found in the “silting up” and the formation of new land, which result from
the action of vegetation upon silt-bearing waters. The closeness of the relation
between succession and the forms of the land has led to the application
of the term “physiographic ecology” to that part of the subject which deals
with the development of vegetation, i. e., succession.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>22. Soil physics.</b> This subject is as much a part of ecology as is forestry.
It is intrinsically that subdivision of ecology which deals with the edaphic
factors of the habitat, and their relation to the plant. Since the basis is
physics, there has been a general tendency to overvalue the determination
of soil properties, and to ignore the fact that these are decisive only when
considered with reference to the living plant. As the soil contains the
water which is the factor of greatest importance to plants, soil physics is an
especially important part of ecology. Its methods are discussed under the
habitat.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>23. Zoogeography.</b> Since animals are free for the most part, and hence
not confined so strictly to one spot as plants, their dependence upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>habitat is not so evident. The relation is further obscured by the fact that
no physical factor has the direct effect upon them which water or light
exerts upon the plant. Vegetation, indeed, as the source of food and protection,
plays a more obvious, if not a more important part. This is
especially true of anthophilous insects, but it also holds for all herbivorous
animals, and, through them, for carnivorous ones. The animal ecology of
a particular region can only be properly investigated after the habitats and
plant formations have been carefully studied. Here, as in floristics, a great
deal can be done in the way of listing the fauna, or studying the life habits
of its species, without any knowledge of plant ecology; but an adequate
study must be based upon a knowledge of the vegetation. Although animal
formations are often poorly defined, there can be no doubt of their existence.
Frequently they coincide with plant formations, and then have very
definite limits. They exhibit both development and structure, and are subject
to the laws of invasion, succession, zonation, and alternation, though
these are not altogether similar to those known for plants, a fact readily
explained by the motility of animals. Considered from the above point
of view, zoogeography is a virgin field, and it promises great things to the
student who approaches it with the proper training.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>24. Sociology.</b> In its fundamental aspects, sociology is the ecology of a
particular species of animal, and has in consequence, a similar close connection
with plant ecology. The widespread migration of man and his
social nature have resulted in the production of groups or communities
which have much more in common with plant formations than do formations
of other animals. The laws of association apply with especial force to
the family, tribe, community, etc., while the laws of succession are essentially
the same for both plants and man. At first thought it might seem
that man’s ability to change his dwelling-place and to modify his environment
exempts him in large measure from the influence of the habitat. The
exemption, however, is only apparent, as the control exerted by climate,
soil, and physiography is all but absolute, particularly when man’s dependence
upon vegetation, both natural and cultural, is called to mind.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Essentials of a System</span></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>25. Cause and effect: habitat and plant.</b> In seeking to lay the foundation
for a broad and thorough system of ecological research, it is necessary to
scan the whole field, and to discriminate carefully between what is fundamental
and what is merely collateral. The chief task is to discover, if
possible, such a guiding principle as will furnish a basis for a permanent
and logical superstructure. In ecology, the one relation which is precedent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>to all others is the one that exists between the habitat and the plant. This
relation has long been known, but its full value has yet to be appreciated.
It is precisely the relation that exists between cause and effect, and its fundamental
importance lies in the fact that all questions concerning the plant
lead back to it ultimately. Other relations are important, but no other is
paramount, or able to serve as the basis of ecology. Ecology sums up this
relation of cause and effect in a single word, and it may be that this advantage
will finally cause its general acceptance as the proper name for
this great field.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the further analysis of the connection between the habitat and the plant,
it is evident that the causes or factors of the habitat act directly upon the
plant as an individual, and at the same time upon plants as groups of individuals.
The latter in no wise decreases the importance of the plant as
the primary effect of the habitat, but it gives form to research by making it
possible to consider two great natural groups of phenomena, each characterized
by very different categories of effects. Ecology thus falls naturally
into three great fundamental fields of inquiry: habitat, plant, and formation
(or vegetation). To be sure, the last can be approached only through the
plant, but as the latter is not an individual, but the unit of a complex from
the formational standpoint, the formation itself may be regarded as a sort
of multiple organism, which is in many ways at least a direct effect of the
habitat. In emphasizing this fundamental relation of habitat and vegetation,
it is imperative not to ignore the fact that neither plant nor formation
is altogether the effect of its present habitat. A third element must always
be considered, namely, the historical fact, by which is meant the ancestral
structure. Upon analysis, however, this is in its turn found to be the product
of antecedent habitats, and in consequence the essential connection between
the habitat and the plant is seen to be absolute.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>26. The place of function.</b> In the foregoing it is understood that the
immediate effect of the physical factors of the habitat is to be found in the
functions of the plant, and that these determine the plant structure. Function
has so long been the especial theme of plant physiology that methods
of investigation are numerous and well known, and it is unnecessary here
to consider it further than to indicate its general bearing. The essential
sequence in ecological research, then, is the one already indicated, viz.,
habitat, plant, and formation, and this will constitute the order of treatment
in the following pages. That portion of floristic which is not mere descriptive
botany belongs to the consideration of the formation, and in consequence
there will be no special treatment of floristic as a subdivision of
ecology.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II. THE HABITAT</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c018'><span class='sc'>Concept and Analysis</span></h3>

<p class='c016'><b>27. Definition of the habitat.</b> The habitat is the sum of all the forces or
factors present in a given area. It is the exact equivalent of the term environment,
though the latter is commonly used in a more general sense. As
an ecological concept, the habitat refers to an area much more definite in
character, and more sharply limited in extent than the habitat of species as
indicated in the manuals. Since the careful study of habitats has scarcely
begun, it is impossible to recognize and delimit them in an absolute sense.
Visible topographic boundaries often exist, but in many cases, the limit,
though actual, is not readily perceived. Contiguous habitats may be sharply
limited, or they may pass into each other so gradually that no real line of
demarcation can be drawn. Whatever variations they may show, however,
all habitats agree in the possession of certain essential factors, which are
universally present. On the other hand, a few factors are merely incidental
and may be present or absent. The relative value and amount of these is
probably similar for no two habitats, though the latter readily fall into
groups with reference to the amount of some particular factor.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>28. Factors.</b> The factors of a habitat are water-content, humidity, light,
temperature, soil, wind, precipitation, pressure, altitude, exposure, slope,
surface (cover), and animals. To these should be added gravity and polarity,
which are practically uniform for all habitats, and may, in consequence, be
ignored in this treatise. Length of season, while it plays an important part
in vegetation, is clearly a complex and is to be treated under its constituents.
Of the factors given, all are regularly found in each habitat, though some
are not constantly present. The first five, water-content, humidity, light,
temperature, and soil are the most important, and any one may well serve
as a basis for grouping habitats into particular classes with reference to
quantity. As will be pointed out later, however, water-content and light
furnish the most striking differences between habitats, and offer the best
means of classification. As habitats are inseparable from the formations
which they bear, the discussion of the kinds of habitats is reserved for
chapter IV.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>Classification of Factors</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>29. The nature of factors.</b> The factors of a habitat are arranged in two
groups according to their nature: (1) physical, (2) biotic. In the strict
sense, the physical factors constitute the habitat proper, and are the real
causative forces. No habitat escapes the influence of biotic factors, however,
as the formation always reacts upon it, and the influence of animals
is usually felt in some measure. Physical factors are further grouped into
(1) climatic and (2) edaphic, with respect to source, or, better, the medium
in which they are found. Climatic, or atmospheric factors are humidity,
light, temperature, wind, pressure, and precipitation. Axiomatically, the
stimuli which they produce are especially related to the leaf. Edaphic or
soil factors are confined to the soil, as the term denotes, and are immediately
concerned with the functions of the root. Water-content is by
far the most important of these; the others are soil composition (nutrient-content),
soil temperature, altitude, slope, exposure, and surface. The last
four are of a more general character than the others, and are usually referred
to as physiographic factors. Cover, when dead, might well be placed
among these also, but as it is little different from the living cover in effect, it
seems most logical to refer it to biotic factors.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>30. The influence of factors.</b> While the above classification is both obvious
and convenient, a more logical and intimate grouping may be made
upon the influence which the factor exerts. On this basis, factors are
divided into (1) direct, (2) indirect, and (3) remote. Direct factors are
those which act directly upon an important function of the plant and produce
a formative effect: for example, an increase in humidity produces an immediate
decrease in transpiration. They are water-content, humidity, and
light. Other factors have a direct action: thus temperature has an immediate
influence upon respiration and probably assimilation also, but it is
not structurally formative. Wind has a direct mechanical effect upon woody
plants, but it does not fall within our definition. Indirect factors are those
that affect a formative function of the plant through another factor; thus
a change in temperature causes a change in humidity and this in turn calls
forth a change in transpiration; or, a change in soil texture increases the
water-content, and this affects the imbibition of the root-hairs. Indirect
factors, then, are temperature, wind, pressure, precipitation, and soil composition.
Remote factors are, for the most part, physiographic and biotic:
they require at least two other factors to act as middlemen. Altitude affects
plants through pressure, which modifies humidity, and hence transpiration.
Slope determines in large degree the run-off during a rainstorm, thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>affecting water-content and the amount of water absorbed. Earthworms
and plant parts change the texture of the soil, and thereby the water-content.
Indirect factors often exert a remote influence also, as may be seen in the
effect which temperature and wind have in increasing evaporation from the
soil, and thus reducing the water-content. This distinction between factors
may seem insufficiently grounded. In this event, it should be noted that it
centers the effects of all factors upon the three direct ones, water-content,
humidity, and light. If it further be recalled that these are the only factors
which produce qualitative structural changes, and that the classification of
ecads and formations is based upon them, the validity of the distinction is
clear.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>The Determination of Factors</span></h3>

<p class='c016'><b>31. The need of exact measurement.</b> Any serious endeavor to find in the
habitat those causes which are producing modification in the plant and in
vegetation can not stop with the factors merely. The next step is to determine
the quantity of each. It is not sufficient to hazard a guess at this,
or to make a rough estimate of it. Habitats differ in all degrees, and it is
impossible to institute comparisons between them without an exact measure
of each factor. Similarly, one can not trace the adaptations of species to
their proper causes unless the quantity of each factor is known. It is of
little value to know the general effect of a factor, unless it is known to
what degree this effect is exerted. For this purpose it becomes necessary
to appeal to instruments, in order to determine the exact amount of each
factor that is present in a particular habitat, and hence to determine the
ratio between the stimulus and the amount of structural adjustment which
results. The employment of instruments of precision is clearly indispensable
for the task which we have set for ecology, and every student that
intends to strike at the root of the subject, and to make lasting contributions
to it, must familiarize himself with instrumental methods. One great benefit
will accrue to ecology as soon as this fact is generally recognized. The use
of instruments and the application of results obtained from them demand
much patience and seriousness of purpose upon the part of the student. As
a consequence, there will be a general exodus from ecology of those that
have been attracted to it as the latest botanical fad, and have done so much
to bring it into disrepute.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>32. The value of meteorological methods.</b> At the outset there must be
a very clear understanding that weather records and readings have only a
very general value. This is in spite of the fact that the instruments employed
are of standard precision. An important reason for this lack of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>value is that readings are not made in a particular habitat; as a rule, indeed,
they are made in towns and cities, and hence are far removed from masses
of vegetation. They are usually taken at considerable heights, and give but
a general indication of the conditions at the level of vegetation. The chief
difficulty, however, is that the factors observed at weather stations—temperature,
pressure, wind, and precipitation—are those which have the least
value for the ecologist. It is true that a knowledge of the temperature and
rainfall of a great region will afford some idea of the general character of
its vegetation. A proper understanding of such a vegetation is, however,
to be gained only through the exact study of its component formations.
Ecology has already incurred sufficient censure as a subject composed of
very general ideas, and the use of meteorological data, which can never be
connected definitely with anything in the plant or the formation, should be
discontinued. This must not be understood to mean that meteorological instruments
can not be used in the proper place and manner, i. e., in the habitat.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>33. Habitat determination.</b> It is self-evident that determinations of
factors by instruments can only be of value in the habitat where they are
made. In other words, a habitat is a unit for purposes of measuring its
factors, and measures of one habitat have no exact value in another. This
fact can not be overstated. Thus, while it is perfectly legitimate, and indeed
highly desirable, to locate thermographs in different mountain zones for
ascertaining the rate at which temperature decreases with altitude, the
data obtained in this way are not directly applicable in explanation of plant
or formation changes, except when the same species occurs at different altitudes.
Special methods are valuable and often absolutely necessary, but
in view of the fact that the plant as well as the formation is the definite
product of a definite habitat, the fundamental rule in instrumentation is
that complete readings must be made within a habitat for that habitat alone.
This necessarily presupposes a certain preliminary acquaintance with the
habitat to be investigated, as it is imperative that the station for making
readings be located well within the formation, in order to avoid transition
conditions. In vegetation, there are as many habitats as formations, and
in addition a large number of new and denuded habitats upon which successions
have not yet started; a knowledge of each formation or succession
must rest ultimately upon the factors of its particular habitat.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>34. Determinable and efficient differences.</b> The instruments employed in
studying habitats can not be too exact, as there is no adequate knowledge as
yet concerning the real differences which exist between related or contiguous
formations. This is particularly true of differences which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>efficient in producing a recognizable structural change in plant or formation.
Investigations made by the writer have shewn that standard instruments
will measure differences of quantity quite too small to produce a visible reaction.
Efficient differences are not the same for different factors, and
perhaps also for the same factor when found in various combinations. They
vary widely for different species, being in direct relation to the plasticity of
the latter. The point necessary to bear in mind in formulating methods for
habitat investigation and in making use of instruments is that standard instruments
should be used for the very reason that we do not yet know the
relation between determinable and efficient differences. On the other hand,
it is unnecessary to insist upon absolute exactness as soon as it is found that
the determinable difference lies well within the efficient one. This by no
means indicates that instruments are not to be carefully standardized and
frequently checked, or that accurate readings should not be made. It
means that a slight margin of error may be permitted in a machine which
registers well within the efficient difference for that factor, and that instruments
that read to the last degree of nicety are not absolutely necessary. In
the fundamental work of determining efficient differences, however, instruments
can not have too great precision. Moreover, these differences must be
based upon the most plastic species of a formation, and the readings must
be made under normal conditions.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>Instrumentation</span></h3>

<p class='c016'><b>35. Methods.</b> In the field use of instruments two methods have been developed.
The first in point of time was the method of simple instruments,
devised especially for class work, and capable of being used only where a
number of trained students are available. The method of automatic instruments
was an immediate outgrowth of this, due to the necessity which confronts
the solitary investigator of being in different habitats at the same
time. In the gradual evolution of this subject, it has become possible to
combine the two methods in such a way as to retain all the advantages of
the automatic method, and most of those of the method of simple
instruments.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>36. Method of simple instruments.</b> By simple instruments are denoted
those that do not record, but must be read by the observer at the time.
They are standard instruments of precision, but possess the disadvantage
of requiring an observer for each one. They are well illustrated by the
thermometers and psychrometers used by the Weather Bureau. In the
hands of trained observers the results obtained are unimpeachable; in fact,
standard simple instruments must be constantly employed to check automatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>ones. As physical factors vary greatly through the day and through the
year, it is all-important that the readings in habitats which are being compared
should be made at the same instant. This requires a number of observers;
as many as twelve stations have been read at one time, and there is
of course no limit to the number. It is very important, also, that observers be
carefully trained in the handling of instruments, and in reading them accurately
and intelligently at the proper moment. In practice it has been
found impossible to do such work in elementary classes, and, even in using
small advanced classes, prolonged drill has been necessary before trustworthy
results could be obtained. When a class has once been thoroughly
trained in making accurate simultaneous readings, there is practically no
limit, other than that set by time, to the valuable work that can be done,
both in instruction and investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>37. Method of automatic instruments.</b> The solitary investigator must
replace trained helpers by automatic instruments or ecographs. These have
the very great advantages of giving continuous simultaneous records for
long periods, and of having no personal equation. They must be regulated
and checked, to be sure, but as this is all done by the same person, the error
is negligible. There is nothing more satisfactory in resident investigation
than a series of accurate recording instruments in various habitats. Ecographs
have two disadvantages. The chief perhaps is cost. The expense
of a single “battery” which will record light, water-content, humidity, and
temperature is about $250. Another difficulty is that they can be used
only within a few miles of the base, since they require attention every week
for regulation, change of record, etc. While this means that ecographs in
their present form are not adapted to reconnaissance, this is not a real disadvantage,
as the scattered observations possible on such a journey can best
be made by simple instruments.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>38. Combined methods.</b> The best results by far are to be obtained by the
combined use of simple and automatic instruments. This is particularly true
in research, but it applies also to class instruction. The ecographs afford a
continuous, accurate basal record, to which a single reading made at any
time or place can be readily referred for comparison. On the other hand,
it is an easy matter to carry a full complement of simple instruments on the
daily field trips, and to make accurate readings in a score or more of formations
in a single day. An isolated reading, especially of a climatic factor,
has little or no value in itself, but when it can be compared with a reading
made at the same time in the base station by an ecograph, it is the equivalent
of an automatic reading. This method renders a set of simple instruments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>more desirable for a long trip or reconnaissance than a battery of automatic
ones. It is practically impossible to carry the latter into the field, and in any
event a continuous record is out of the question. As there are other tasks
at such times also, it becomes evident that the taking of single readings
which can be compared with a continuous record offers the most satisfactory
solution.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>Construction and Use of Instruments</span></h3>

<p class='c016'><b>39. The selection of instruments.</b> In selecting and devising instruments
for the investigation of physical factors, emphasis has first been laid upon
accuracy. This is the result of a feeling that it is better to have instruments
that read too minutely than those which do not make distinctions that are
sufficiently close, particularly until more has been learned about efficient
differences. On the other hand, no hesitation has been felt in employing instruments
which are not absolutely accurate, when it was clear that the
error was less than the efficient difference. Similarly, the margin of error
practically eliminates itself in the case of simultaneous comparative readings,
when the instruments have been checked to the same standard. Simplicity
of construction and operation are of great importance, especially in saving
time where a large number of instruments are in operation. Expense is
likewise to be carefully considered. It is impossible to have too many instruments,
but cost practically determines the number that can be obtained.
It is further necessary to secure or invent both simple and automatic instruments
for all factors, except such invariable ones as altitude, slope, etc.
Simple instruments must be of a kind that can be easily carried, and so constructed
that they can be used at a minimum of risk. The sling psychrometer,
for example, is very readily broken in field use, and it has been
replaced by a protected modification, the rotating form.</p>

<p class='c007'>In describing the construction and operation of the many factor instruments,
there has been no attempt to make the treatment exhaustive. Those
instruments which the author has found of greatest value in his own work
are given precedence, and the manner of using them is described in detail.
Other instruments of value are also considered, though with greater brevity.
Some of the most complex and expensive ones have been ignored, as it is
altogether improbable that they can come into general use in their present
form. While the conviction is felt that the methods described below will
enable the most advanced investigators to carry on thorough work, it is
hoped that they will be seen to be so fundamental, and so attractive, that they
will appeal to all who are planning serious ecological study.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>WATER-CONTENT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>40. Value of different instruments.</b> The paramount importance of water-content
as a direct factor in the modification of plant form and distribution
gives a fundamental value to the methods used for its determination. Automatic
instruments for ascertaining the water in the soil are costly, in addition
to being complicated, and often inaccurate. For these reasons, much
attention has been given to developing the simpler but more reliable methods
in which a soil borer or geotome is used. The latter is simple, inexpensive,
and accurate. It can be carried easily upon daily trips or upon longer reconnaissances,
and is
always ready for instant
use. In the determination
of physiological water-content,
it is practically indispensable.
Indeed, the
readiness with which geotome
determinations of
water-content can be made
should hasten the universal
recognition of the fact that
it is the available, and not
the total amount of water
in the soil, which determines
the effect upon the
plant.</p>

<p>Fig. 1. Geotomes and soil can.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>41. The geotome.</b> In its
simplest form, the geotome
is merely a stout iron tube
with a sharp cutting edge
at one end and a firmly
attached handle at the
other. The length is variable and is primarily determined by the location
of the active root surface of the plant. In xerophytic habitats, generally a
longer tube is necessary than in mesophytic ones. The bore is largely
determined by the character of the soil; for example, a larger one is necessary
for gravel than for loam. Tubes of small bore also tend to pack the
soil below them, and to give a correspondingly incomplete core. The best
results have been obtained with geotomes of ½–1 inch tube. Each geotome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>has a removable rod, flattened into a disk at one end, and bent at the other,
for forcing out the core after it has been cut from the soil. Sets of geotomes
have been made in lengths of 5, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 25 inches. The 12– and
15–inch forms have been commonly used for herbaceous formations and
layers. They are marked in inches so that a sample of any lesser depth may
be readily taken. Such a device is very necessary for gravel soils and in
mountain regions, where the subsoil of rock lies close to the surface.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>42. Soil borers.</b> There is a large variety of soil borers to choose from,
but none have been found as simple and satisfactory for relatively shallow
readings as the geotome just described. For deep-rooted plants, many
xerophytes, shrubs, and trees, borers of the auger type are necessary.
These are large and heavy, and of necessity slow in operation. They can
not well be carried in an ordinary outfit of instruments, and the size of the
soil sample itself precludes the use of such
instruments far from the base station, except
on trips made expressly for obtaining samples
from deep-seated layers. For depths from
two to eight feet, the Fraenkel borer is perhaps
the most satisfactory, except for the
coarser gravels: it costs $14 or $20 according
to the length. For greater depths, or when
a larger core is desirable, the Bausch &#38; Lomb
borer, number 16536, which costs $5.25,
should be made use of. This is a ponderous
affair and can be employed only on special
occasions. On account of the size of samples
obtained by these borers, it is usually most
satisfactory to take a small sample from the
core at different depths. Frequently, indeed,
a hand trowel may be readily used to obtain
a good sample at a particular depth.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>43. Taking samples of soil.</b> In obtaining soil samples, the usual practice
is to remove the air-dried surface, noting its depth, and to sink the geotome
with a slow, gentle, boring movement, in order to avoid packing the soil.
This difficulty is further obviated by deep notches with sharp, beveled edges
which are cut at the lower end. In obtaining a fifteen-inch core, there is
also less compression if it be cut five inches at a time. Repeated tests have
shown, however, that the single compressed sample is practically as trustworthy
as the one made in sections. The water-content of the former
constantly fell within .5 per cent of that of the latter, and both varied less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>than 1 per cent from the dug sample used as a check. As soon as dug, the
core is pressed out of the geotome by the plunger directly into an air-tight
soil can. Bottles may be used as containers, but tin cans are lighter and
more durable. Aluminum cans have been devised for this purpose, but on
account of the expense, “Antikamnia” cans have been used instead. These
are tested, and those that are not water-tight are rejected, although it has
been found that, even in these, ordinary soils do not lose an appreciable
amount of water in twenty-four hours. The lid should be screwed on as
quickly as possible, and, as an added precaution, the cans are kept in a close
case until they have been weighed. The cans are numbered consecutively
on both lid and side in such a way that the number may be read at a glance.
The numbers are painted, as a label wears off too rapidly, and scratched
numbers are not quickly
discerned.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>44. Weighing.</b> Although
soil samples
have been kept in tight
cans outside of cases
for several days without
losing a milligram of
moisture, the safest plan
is to make it a rule to
weigh cans as quickly
as possible after bringing
them in from the
field. Moreover, when
delicate balances are
available, it is a good
practice to weigh to the
milligram. At remote
bases, however, and
particularly in the field,
and on reconnaissance, where delicate, expensive instruments are out of
place, coarser balances, which weigh accurately to one centigram, give
satisfactory results. The study of efficient water-content values has already
gone far enough to indicate that differences less than 1 per cent are negligible.
Indeed, the soil variation in a single square meter is often as
great as this. The greatest difference possible in the third place, i. e., that
of 9 milligrams, does not produce a difference of .1 of 1 per cent in
the water-content value. In consequence, such strong portable balances
as Bausch &#38; Lomb 12308 ($2), which can be carried anywhere, give entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>reliable results. The best procedure is to weigh the soil with the can.
Turning the soil out upon the pan or upon paper obviates one weighing,
but there is always some slight loss, and the chances of serious mishap are
many. After weighing, the sample is dried as rapidly as possible in a
water bath or oven. At a temperature of 100° C. this is accomplished
ordinarily in twenty-four hours; the most tenacious clays require a longer
time, or a higher temperature. High temperatures should be avoided,
however, for soils that contain much leaf mould or other organic matter,
in order that this may not be destroyed. When it is necessary on trips,
soil samples can be dried in the sun or even in the air. This usually takes
several days, however, and a test weighing is generally required before one
can be certain that the moisture is entirely gone. The weighing of the
dried soil is made as before, and the can is carefully brushed out and
weighed. The weight of aluminum cans may be determined once for all,
but with painted cans it has been the practice to weigh them each time.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>45. Computation.</b> The most direct method of expressing the water-content
is by per cents figured upon the moist soil as a basis. The ideal
way would be to determine the actual amount of water per unit volume,
but as this would necessitate weighing one unit volume at least in every
habitat studied, as a preliminary step, it is not practicable. The actual
process of computation is extremely simple. The weight of the dried
sample, <em>w</em><sup>1</sup>, is subtracted from the weight of the original sample, <em>w</em>, and
the weight of the can, <em>w</em><sup>2</sup>, is likewise subtracted from <em>w</em>. The first result
is then divided by the second, giving the per cent of water, or the physical
water-content. The formula is: (<em>w</em> − <em>w</em><sup>1</sup>)/(<em>w</em> − <em>w</em><sup>2</sup>) = <em>W</em>. The result is expressed preferably
in grams per hundred grams of moist soil; thus ²⁰⁄₁₀₀, from which
the per cent of water-content may readily be figured on the basis of dry
or moist soil.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>46. Time and location of readings.</b> Owing to the daily change in the
amount of soil water due to evaporation, gravity, and rainfall, an isolated
determination of water-content has very little value. It is a primary requisite
that a basis for comparison be established by making (1) a series
of readings in the same place, (2) a series at practically the same time in
a number of different places or habitats, or (3) by combining the two
methods, and following the daily changes of a series of stations throughout
an entire season, or at least for a period sufficient to determine the
approximate maximum and minimum. The last procedure can hardly be
carried out except at a base station, but here it is practically indispensable.
It has been followed both at Lincoln and at Minnehaha, resulting in a
basal series for each place that is of the greatest importance. When such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>base already exists, or, better, while it is being established, scattered readings
may be used somewhat profitably. As a practical working rule, however,
it is most convenient and satisfactory to make all determinations consecutively,
i. e., in a series of stations or of successive days. Under ordinary
conditions, the time of day at which a particular sample is taken is of little
importance, as the variation during a day is usually slight. This does
not hold for exposed wet soils, and especially for soils which have just been
wetted by rains. In all comparative series, however, the samples should be
taken at the same hour whenever possible. This is particularly necessary
when it is desired to ascertain the daily decrease of water-content in the
same spot. In the case of a series of stations, these should be read always
in the same order, at the same time of day, and as rapidly as possible. When
a daily station series is being run, i. e., a series by days and stations both,
the daily reading for each place should fall at the same time. While there
are certain advantages in making readings either early or late in the day,
they may be made at any time if the above precautions are followed.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>47. Location of readings.</b> Samples should invariably be taken in spots
which are both typical and normal, especially when they are to be used as
representative of a particular area or habitat. A slight change in slope, soil composition,
in the amount of dead or living cover, etc., will produce considerable
change in the amount of water present. Where habitat and
formation are uniform, fewer precautions are necessary. This is a rare circumstance,
and as a rule determinations must be made wherever appreciable
differences are in evidence. The problem is simpler when readings are taken
with reference to the structure or modifications of a particular species, but
even here, check readings in several places are of great value. The variation
of water in a spot apparently uniform has been found to be slight in the
prairies and the mountains. In taking three samples in spots a few inches to
several feet apart, the difference in the amount of water has rarely exceeded
1 per cent, which is practically negligible. Gardner<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a> found that 16
samples taken to a depth of 3 inches, in as many different portions of a
carefully prepared, denuded soil plot, showed a variation of 7½ per cent.
This is partially explained by the shallowness of the samples, but even then
the results of the two investigations are in serious conflict and indicate that
the question needs especial study. It should be further pointed out that all
readings should be made well within a particular area, and not near its
edge, and that, in the case of large diversified habitats, it is the consocies
and the society which indicate the obvious variations in the structure of
the habitat.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span><b>48. Depth of samples.</b> The general rule is that the depth of soil samples
is determined by the layer to which the roots penetrate. The practice
is to remove the air-dried surface in which no roots are found, and to
take a sample to the proper depth. This method is open to some objection,
as the actively absorbing root surfaces are often localized. There is no
practical way of taking account of this as yet, except in the case of deep-rooted
xerophytes and woody plants. It is practicable to determine the
location of the active root area of a particular plant and hence the water-content
of the soil layer, but in most formations, roots penetrate to such
different depths that a sample which includes the greater part of the distance
concerned is satisfactory. Some knowledge of the soil of a formation is also
necessary, since shallow soils do not require as deep samples as others. The
same is true of shaded soils without reference to their depth, and, in large
measure, of soils supplied with telluric water. In all cases, it is highly desirable
to have numerous control-samples at different depths. The normal
cores are 12 or 15 inches; control-samples are taken every 5 inches to the
depth desired, and in some cases 3–inch sections are made. It has been
found a great saving of time to combine these methods. A 5–inch sample is
taken and placed in one can, then a second one, and a third in like manner.
In this way the water-content of each 5–inch layer is determined, and from
the combined weight the total content is readily ascertained.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>49. Check and control instruments.</b> A number of instruments throw
much light upon the general relations of soil water. The rain-gauge, or
ombrometer, measures the periodical replenishment of the water supply,
and has a direct bearing upon seasonal variation. The atmometer affords
a clue to the daily decrease of water by evaporation, and thus supplements
the rain-gauge. The run-off gauge enables one to establish a direct connection
between water-content and the slope and character of the surface. The
amount and rapidity of absorption are determined by means of a simple instrument
termed a rhoptometer. The gravitation water of a soil is ascertained
by a hizometer, and some clue to the hygroscopic and capillary water
may be obtained by an artificial osmotic cell. All of these are of importance
because they serve to explain the water-content of a particular soil with
especial reference to the other factors of the habitat. It is evident that none
of them can actually be used in exact determinations of the amount of
water, and they will be considered under the factors with which, they are
more immediately concerned.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Physical and Physiological Water</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>50. The availability of soil water.</b> The amount of water present in a
soil is no real index to the influence of water-content as a factor of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>habitat. All soils contain more water than can be absorbed by the plants
which grow in them. This residual water, which is not available for use,
varies for different soils. It is greatest in the compact soils, such as clay
and loam, and least in the loose ones, as sand and gravel. It differs, but to a
much less degree, from one species to another. A plant of xerophytic tendency
is naturally able to remove more water from the same soil than one of
mesophytic or hydrophytic character. As the species of a particular formation
owe their association chiefly to their common relation to the water-content
of the habitat, this difference is of little importance in the field. In
comparing the structure of formations, and especially that of the plants which
are found in them, the need to distinguish the available water from the total
amount is imperative. Thus, water-contents of 15 per cent in gravel and in
clay are in no wise comparable. A coarse gravel containing 15 per cent
of water is practically saturated. The plants which grow upon it are
mesophytes of a strong hydrophytic tendency, and they are able to use 14½
or all but .5 out of the 15 per cent of water. In a compact clay, only 3½
of the 15 per cent are available, and the plants growing in it are marked
xerophytes. It is evident that a knowledge merely of the physical water-content
is actually misleading in such cases, and this holds true of comparisons
of any soils which differ considerably in texture. After one has
determined the physiological water for the great groups of soils, it is more
or less possible to estimate the amounts in the various types of each. As
an analysis is necessary to show how close soils are in texture, this is
little better than a guess, and for accurate work it is indispensable that the
available water be determined for each habitat. Within the same formation,
however, after this has once been carefully ascertained, it is perfectly satisfactory
to convert physical water-content into available by subtracting the
non-available water, which under normal conditions in the field remains
practically the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>The importance of knowing the available water is even greater in those
habitats in which salts, acids, cold, or other factors than the molecular attraction
of soil particles increase the amount of water which the plant can
not absorb. Few careful investigations of such soils have yet been made,
and the relation of available to non-available water in them is almost entirely
unknown. It is probable that the phenomena in some of these will be
found to be produced by other factors.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>51. Terms.</b> The terms, physiological water-content, and physical water-content,
are awkward and not altogether clear in their application. It is
here proposed to replace them by short words which will refer directly to
the availability of the soil water for absorption by the plant. Accordingly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the total amount of water in the soil is divided into the available and the
non-available water-content. The terms suggested for these are respectively,
<em>holard</em> (ὅλos, whole, ἅpδov, water), <em>chresard</em> (χοῆςις, use), and <em>echard</em> (ἕχω,
to withhold).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>52. Chresard determinations under control.</b> The determination of the
chresard in the field is attended with peculiar difficulties. In consequence,
the method of obtaining it under control will first be described. The
inquiry may be made with reference to soils in general or to the soil of
a particular formation. In the last case, if the plants used are from the same
formation, the results will have almost the value of a field determination.
When no definite habitat is the subject of investigation, an actual soil, and
not an artificial mixture, should be used, and the plants employed should be
mesophytes. The individual plants are grown from seeds in the proper
soils, and are repotted sufficiently often to keep the roots away from the
surface. The last transfer is made to a pot large enough to permit the plant
to become full-grown without crowding the roots. The pot should be glazed
inside and out in order to prevent the escape of moisture. This interferes
slightly with the aeration of the soil, but it will not cause any real difficulty.
The plant is watered in such a way as to make the growth as normal as
possible. After it has become well established, three soil samples are taken
in such a manner that they will give the variation in different parts of the
pot. One is taken near the plant, the second midway between the plant and
the edge of the pot, and the third near the edge. The depth is determined
by the size of the pot and the position of the roots. The holard is determined
for these in the usual way, but the result is expressed with reference to 100
grams of dry soil; the average is taken as representative. The soil is then
allowed to dry out slowly, as sudden drouth will sometimes impair the power
of absorption and a plant will wilt although considerable available water
remains. Plants often wilt in the field daily for several successive hot dry
days, and become completely turgid again during the night. If the drying
out takes place slowly, the plant will not recover after it has once begun
to wilt. The proper time to make the second reading is indicated by the
pronounced wilting of the leaves and shoots. Complete wilting occurs, as
a rule, only after the younger parts have drawn for some time upon the
watery tissues of the stem and root, by which time evaporation has considerably
deceased the water in the soil. It is a well-known fact that young
leaves do not wilt easily, especially in watery or succulent plants. Three
samples are again taken and the average water-content determined as
above. This is the non-available water or the echard. The latter is then
computed on the basis of 100 grams of dry soil, and this result is subtracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>from the holard to give the chresard in grams for each 100 grams of dry
weight. The chresard may also be expressed with respect to 100 grams of
moist soil. As a final precaution in basal work, it is advisable to determine
the chresard for six individuals of the same species under as nearly the
same conditions as possible. When it is desired, however, to find the
average chresard for a particular soil, it is necessary to employ various
species representing diverse phyads and ecads. Such an investigation is
necessarily very complicated, and must be made the subject of special
inquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>53. Chresard readings in the field.</b> The especial difficulties which must
be overcome in the field are the exclusion of rain and dew and the cutting
off of the capillary water. It is evident, of course, that experiments of this
sort must also be entirely free from outside disturbance. The choice of an
area depends upon the scope of the study. If the chresard is sought for a
particular consocies, the block of soil to be studied should show several
species which are fairly representative. In case the chresard of a certain
species is to be obtained, this species alone need be present, but it should
be represented by several individuals. Check plots are desirable in either
event, and at least two or three which are as nearly uniform as possible
should be chosen. The size and depth of the soil block depends upon the
plants concerned.  It must be large enough that the roots of the particular
individuals under investigation are not disturbed. There is a limit to the
size of the mass that can be handled readily, and in consequence the test
plants must not be too large or too deeply rooted. The task of cutting out
the soil block requires a spade with a long sharp blade. After ascertaining
the spread and depth of the roots, the block is cut so that a margin of several
inches free from the roots concerned is left on the sides and bottom. If
the block is to be lifted out of place, so that the sides are exposed to evaporation,
this allowance should be greater. In some cases, it may be found
more convenient to dig the plant up, place it in a large pot, and put the latter
back in the hole. As a general practice, however, this is much less satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the block has been cut, it may be moved if the soil is sufficiently compact,
and then allowed to dry out in its own formation or elsewhere. The
results are most valuable in the first case, though it is often an advantage
to remove blocks cut from shade or wet formations to dry, sunny stations
where they will dry more rapidly. The most satisfactory and natural
method, however, is to leave the block in place, and to prevent the reestablishment
of capillary action by enclosing it within plates. This is accomplished
by slipping thin sheet-iron plates into position along the cut surfaces.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The plate for the bottom should be somewhat wider than the block, and is
slipped into place by raising the block if the soil is not too loose; in the
latter event, it is carefully driven in. The side plates are then pushed down
to meet the former. The size of the plates depends upon the block; in
general, plates of 1, 2, and 3 feet square, with the bottom plates a trifle
larger, are the most serviceable. Access of rain and dew is prevented by an
awning of heavy canvas which projects far enough beyond each side of the
block to prevent wetting. The height will depend of course upon the size of
the plants. The awning must be used only when rain or heavy dew is threatened,
as the shade which it produces changes the power of the plant to draw
water from the soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time necessary to cause wilting varies with the habitat and the
weather. When the block is large and in position, two or three weeks are
required. This period of drying incidentally furnishes an excellent opportunity
for determining the rate at which the particular soil loses water.
The holard sample is taken daily for several days before the block is cut
out, in order to obtain an average, care being taken of course to avoid a
period of extreme weather. The echard samples are taken as soon as the
wilting is sufficient to indicate that the limit of available water is reached.
The air-dry soil above the roots is first removed. The treatment of the
samples and the computation of the chresard are as previously indicated.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>54. Chresard values of different soils.</b> The following table gives the
water-content values of six representative soils. The per cents of holard
(at saturation) and of echard are those determined by Hedgcock<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a> with six
mesophytes as test plants for each soil. The chresard has been computed
directly from these.</p>

the results obtained for other soils of the respective groups. For accurate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>research, the chresard must of course be ascertained for each formation with
respect to its peculiar plants and soil. The influence of the ecad in more or
less determining the echard is also shown by Hedgcock, who found that
floating plants wilt at 25 per cent, amphibious ones at 15–20 per cent,
mesophytes at 6–12 per cent, and mesophytic xerophytes at 3–6 per cent.
The echard is also somewhat higher for shade plants than for heliophytes.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Records and Results</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>55. The field record.</b> It is superfluous to point out that a definite form
for field records saves much time and prevents many mistakes. The exact
form may be left to personal taste, but there are certain features which are
essential. Many of these are evident, while others may seem unnecessary;
all, however, have been proved by experience to have some value in saving
time or in preventing confusion. The two fundamental maxims of field work
are that nothing is too trivial to be of importance, and that no detail should
be entrusted to the memory. The field record should contain in unmistakable
terms all that the field has yielded. These statements apply with
especial force to water-content, in many senses the most important of
physical factors. The precise character of the record depends upon the way
in which the readings are made, whether scattered or in series. As the
day-station series is of the greatest importance, the record is adapted for it
especially, but it will also serve for all readings. The record is chronological,
since this is the only convenient method for the field. A proper form
for a field record of water-content is the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>A general designation of the soil composition is a material aid, especially
where there is a difference in the core. For example, in a mountain forest
or meadow, the upper layer will usually be mold, the lower sand or gravel.
A careful estimate of the relation between the two throws much light upon
the chresard. Under “sample” the number taken to reach the desired depth,
if more than one, is indicated by placing the number before the depth, thus
2:10. When two or more full cores are included in the same sample for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>check, the order is 10:2. It has already been shown, however, that these
precautions are not necessary for ordinary purposes. In computing the
holard and echard, there is no need to show the figuring, if the process is
checked and then proved. Notes upon sky conditions aid in explaining the
daily decrease in water-content. The amount of rain and the period during
which it falls are of great importance in understanding the fluctuations of
the holard. Under community it is highly desirable to have a list of all the
species, but it is impossible to include this in the table, and a glance at the
formation list will show them. The form indicated above serves for a day-station
series, a daily series in one station for any number of check series
in one spot, and for scattered readings. In many cases the echard will not
be determined, but on account of its primary importance, there should be a
space for it, especially since it may be desirable to determine it at some
later time.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>56. The permanent record.</b> This should be kept by formation, or if the
latter exhibits well-defined associations, the formational record may be
divided accordingly. This may seem an unnecessary expenditure of time,
but a slight experience in finding the water-content values of a particular
habitat, when scattered through a chronological field record, will be convincing.
The form of permanent record is the same as for the field, except
that the column for the formation and that for the society are often unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>57. Sums and means.</b> From the great difficulty of determining the absolute
water-content, and of obtaining a standard of comparison between soils
on account of the varying ratio between bulk and weight, water-content sums
are impracticable. For the same reasons, means of actual water-content
are practically impossible, and the mean water-content must be expressed in
per cents. Daily readings are not essential to a satisfactory mean. In fact,
a single reading at each extreme enables one to approximate the real mean
very closely; thus, the average of 26 readings in the prairie formation is
18 per cent. The extremes are 5 per cent and 28 per cent, and their
average 16.5 per cent. A few readings properly scattered through moist
and dry periods will give a reliable mean, as will also a series of daily readings
from one heavy rain through a long dry period. The one difficulty with
the last method is that such periods can not well be determined beforehand.
Means permit ready comparison between habitats, but in connecting the
modifications of a species with water-content as a cause, the extremes are
significant as indicating the range of conditions. Furthermore, the extremes,
i. e., 5 per cent and 28 per cent, make it possible to approximate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the mean, 18 per cent, while the latter gives little or no clue to the extremes.
It is hardly necessary to state that means and extremes should be determined
for a certain habitat, or particular area of it, and that the results may
be expressed with reference to holard and chresard.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>58. Curves.</b> The value of graphic methods and the details of plotting
curves are reserved for a particular section. It will suffice in this place to
indicate the water-content curves that are of especial value. Simple curves
are made with regard to time, place, or depth. The day curve shows the
fluctuations of the water-content of one station from day to day or from
time to time. The station curve indicates the variation in water from station
to station, while the depth curve represents the different values at various
depths in the same station. These may be combined on the same sheet
in such a way that the station curves of each day may be compared directly.
Similar combinations may be used for comparing the day curves, or the
depth curves of different stations, but these are of less importance. A
combination of curves which is of the greatest value is one which admits of
direct comparison between the station curves of saturation, holard,
chresard, and echard.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>HUMIDITY</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>59. Instruments.</b> As a direct factor, humidity is intimately connected
with water-content in determining the structure and distribution of plants.
The one is in control of water loss; the other regulates water supply.
Humidity as a climatic factor undergoes greater fluctuation in the same
habitat, and the efficient difference is correspondingly greater. Accordingly,
simple instruments are less valuable than automatic ones, since a continuous
record is essential to a proper understanding of the real influence of
humidity. As is the rule, however, the use of simple instruments, when they
can be referred to an ecographic basis, greatly extends the field which can
be studied. In investigation, both psychrometer and psychrograph have
their proper place. In the consideration of simple instruments for obtaining
humidity values, an arbitrary distinction is made between psychrometers
and hygrometers. The former consist of a wet and a dry bulb thermometer,
while the latter make use of a hygroscopic awn, hair, or other object.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Psychrometers</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>60. Kinds.</b> There are three kinds of psychrometer, the sling, the cog,
and the stationary. All consist of a wet bulb and a dry bulb thermometer
set in a case; the first two are designed to be moved or whirled in the air.
The same principle is applied in each, viz., that evaporation produces a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>decrease in temperature proportional to the amount of
moisture in the air. The dry bulb thermometer is an
ordinary thermometer, while the wet bulb is covered with
a cloth that can be moistened. The former indicates the
normal temperature of the air, the latter gives the reduced
temperature due to evaporation. The relative
humidity of the air is ascertained by means of the proper
tables, from two terms, i. e., the air temperature and
the amount of reduction shown by the wet bulb. The
sling and the cog psychrometers alone are in general
use. The stationary form has been found to be unreliable,
because the moisture, as it evaporates from the
wet bulb, is not removed, and, in consequence, hinders
evaporation to the proper degree.</p>

<p>Fig. 5. Sling psychrometer.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>61. The sling psychrometer.</b> The standard form of
this is shown in the illustration, and is the one used by
the Weather Bureau. This instrument can be obtained
from H. J. Green, 1191 Bedford Ave., Brooklyn, or
Julien P. Friez, 107 E. German St., Baltimore, at a cost
of $5. It consists of a metal frame to which are firmly
attached two accurately standardized thermometers,
reading usually from –30° to 130°. The frame is attached
at the uppermost end to a handle in such fashion that
it swings freely. The wet bulb thermometer is placed
lower, chiefly to aid in wetting the cloth more readily.
The cloth for the wet bulb should be always of the same
texture and quality; the standard used by the Weather
Bureau can be obtained from the instrument makers. A
slight difference in texture makes no appreciable error,
but the results obtained with different instruments and
by different observers will be more trustworthy and
comparable if the same cloth be used in all cases. The
jacket for the wet bulb may be sewed in the form of a
close-fitting bag, which soon shrinks and clings tightly.
It may be made in the field by wrapping the cloth
so that the edges just overlap, and tying it tightly above
and below the bulb. In either case, a single layer of
cloth alone must be used. The cloth becomes soiled or
thin after a few months’ constant use and should be
replaced. It is a wise precaution to carry a small piece
of psychrometer cloth in the field outfit.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 6. Cog psychrometer.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>62. Readings.</b> All observations should be made facing the wind, and the
observer should move one or two steps during the reading to prevent the
possibility of error. The cloth of the wet bulb is moistened with water by
means of a brush, or, much better, it is dipped directly into a bottle of water.
Distilled water is preferable, as it contains no dissolved material to accumulate
in the cloth. Tap-water and the water of streams may be used without
appreciable error, if the cloth is changed somewhat more frequently.
The temperature of the water
is practically negligible under
ordinary conditions. Readings
can be made more
quickly, however, when the
temperature is not too far
from that of the air. The
psychrometer is held
firmly and swung rapidly
through the air when the
space is not too confined.
Where there is danger of
breakage, it is swung back
and forth through a short arc,
pendulum-fashion. As the
reading must be made when
the mercury of the wet bulb
reaches the lowest point, the
instrument is stopped from
time to time and the position
of the column noted. The
lowest point is often indicated
by the tendency of the mercury
to remain stationary;
as a rule it can be noted with certainty when the next glance shows a rise
in the column. In following the movement, and especially in noting the
final reading, great care must be taken to make the latter before the mercury
begins to rise. For this reason it is desirable to shade the psychrometer
with the body when looking at it, and to take pains not to breathe
upon the bulbs nor to bring them too near the body. At the moment when
the wet bulb registers the lowest point, the dry bulb should be read and the
results recorded.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>63. Cog psychrometer.</b> This instrument, commonly called the “egg-beater”
psychrometer, has been devised to obviate certain disadvantages of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the sling psychrometer in field work, and has entirely supplanted the latter
in the writer’s own studies. It is smaller, more compact, and the danger of
breaking in carriage or in use is almost nil. It has the great advantage of
making it possible to take readings in a layer of air less than two inches
in thickness, and in any position. Fairly accurate results can even be obtained
from transpiring leaves. The instrument can readily be made by
a good mechanic, at a cost for materials of $1.75, which is less than half the
price for the sling form. A single drawback exists in the use of short,
Centigrade thermometers, inasmuch as tables of relative humidity are
usually expressed in Fahrenheit. It is a simple matter, however, to convert
Centigrade degrees into Fahrenheit, mentally, or the difficulty may be
avoided by the conversion table shown on page <a href='#Page_47'>47</a>, or by constructing a
Centigrade series of humidity tables. The fact that the wet and dry bulbs
revolve in the same path has raised a doubt concerning the accuracy of the
results obtained with this instrument. Repeated comparisons with the
sling psychrometer have not only removed this doubt completely, but have
also proved that the standardization of the thermometers has been efficient.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>64. Construction and use.</b> A convenient form of egg-beater is the Lyon
(Albany, New York), in which the revolving plates can be readily removed,
leaving the axis and the frame. The thermometers used are of the short
Centigrade type. They are 4½ inches long and read from –5° to 50°.
Eimer and Amend, 205 Third Ave., New York city, furnish them at 75
cents each. The thermometers are carefully standardized and compared,
and then grouped in pairs that read together. Each pair is used to construct
a particular psychrometer. Each thermometer is strongly wired to
one side of the frame, pieces of felt being used to protect the tube and increase
the contact. The frame is also bent at the base angles to permit
free circulation of air about the thermometer bulbs. The bulb of one thermometer
is covered with the proper cloth, and the psychrometer is finished.
Since the frame revolves with the thermometers, it is necessary to pour the
water on the wet bulb, or to employ a pipette or brush. The thermometer
bulbs are placed in the layer to be studied, and the frame rotated at an even
rate and with moderate rapidity. The observation is further made as in the
case of the sling psychrometer. As the circle of rotation is less than three
inches in diameter, and the layer less than an inch, in place of nearly three
feet for the sling form, the instrument should not be moved at all for extremely
localized readings, but it must be moved considerably, a foot or
more, if it is desirable to obtain a more general reading.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>65. Hygrometers.</b> While there are instruments designed to indicate the
humidity by means of a hygroscopic substance, not one of them seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>be of sufficient accuracy for use in ecological study. The difficulty is that
the hygroscopic reaction is inconstant, rather than that the instruments are
not sufficiently sensitive. A number of hygrometers have been tested, and
in all the error has been found to be great, varying usually from 10–20 per
cent. In the middle of the scale they sometimes read more accurately, but
toward either extreme they are very inexact. It seems probable that an
accurate hygrometer can be constructed only after the model of the Draper
psychrograph. Its weight and bulk would make it an impossible instrument
for field trips, and the expense
of one would provide
a dozen psychrometers.
In consequence, it does not
seem too sweeping to say
that no hygrometer can
furnish trustworthy results.
Of simple instruments for
humidity, the psychrometer
alone can be trusted
to give reliable readings.
Crova’s hygrometer, used
by Hesselmann, is not a
hygrometer in the sense indicated.
As it is much less
convenient to handle and
to operate than the cog
psychrometer, it is not
necessary to describe it.</p>

<p>Fig. 7. Draper psychrograph.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>66. The Draper psychrograph.</b>
A year’s trial
of the Draper psychrograph
in field and planthouse
has left little question
of its accuracy and its great usefulness. Essentially, it consists of a
band of fine catgut strings, which are sensitive to changes in the moisture-content
of the air. The variations in the length of the band are communicated
to a long pointer carrying an inking pen. The latter traces the
record in per cent of relative humidity on a graduated paper disk, which is
practically the face of an eight-day clock. The whole is enclosed in a metal
case with a glass front. A glance at the illustration will show the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>structure of the instrument. Continued psychrometric tests demonstrate
that the margin of error is well within the efficient difference for humidity,
which is taken to be 5 per cent. In the field tests of the past summer, two
psychrographs placed side by side in the same habitat did not vary 1 per
cent from each other. The same instruments when in different habitats
did not deviate more than 1 per cent from the psychrometric values, except
when the air approached saturation. For humidities above 90 per cent,
the deviation is considerable, but as these are temporary and incident upon
rainfall, the error is not serious. For humidities varying from 10–85 per
cent, the psychrograph is practically as accurate as the psychrometer. Per
cents below 10 are rare, and no tests have been made for them.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 8. Instrument shelter, showing thermograph and psychrograph in position.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>67. Placing the instrument.</b> The psychrograph should be located in a
place where the circulation of the air is typical of the station observed. A
satisfactory shelter will screen the instrument from sun and rain, and at
the same time permit the air to pass freely through the perforations of
the metal case. The form shown in figure 8 meets both of these conditions.
A desirable modification is effected by fastening a strip about the
cover of such depth as to prevent the sun’s rays from striking the case except
when the sun is near the horizon. A cross block is fastened on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>post of the shelter after being exactly leveled. The psychrograph rests upon
this block, which is three feet above the ground in order to avoid the influence
of radiation. The instrument is held in position by slipping the
eye over a small-headed nail driven obliquely. It does not hang from the
latter, but must rest firmly upon the cross block. The post is set to a depth
that prevents oscillation in the wind, which is liable to obscure the record.
In shallow mountain soils stability is attained by fastening a broad board
at the base of the post before setting it. When two or more psychrographs
are established in different habitats, great pains are taken to set them up
in exactly the same way. The shelters are alike, the height above the soil
the same, and the instruments all face the south.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>68. Regulating and operating the instrument.</b> When two or more psychrographs
are to be used in series, they must be compared with each other
in the same spot for several days until they run exactly together with respect
to per cent of humidity and to time. During this comparison they are
checked by the psychrometer and so regulated that they register the proper
humidity. When a single instrument is used alone as the basis to which
simple readings may be referred, all regulating may well be done after the
instrument is in position. This is a simple process; it is accomplished by
obtaining the relative humidity beneath the shelter and at the proper
height by a psychrometer. The pen hand is then moved to the proper line
on the disk by means of the screws at its base. These are reached by removing
the lettered glass face. The thumbscrew on the side opposite the
direction in which the pen is to move is released, and the opposite screw
simultaneously tightened, until the pen remains upon the proper line.
Experience has proved that the record sheet should be correctly labeled and
dated before being placed on the disk. In the press of field duties, records
labeled after removal are liable to be confused. It is likewise a great saving
of time to write the date of the month in the margin of each segment. Care
is taken to place the sheet on the disk in the same position each time; this
can easily be done by seeing that the sharp point on the disk penetrates the
same spot on the paper. A single drop of ink in the pen will usually give
the most satisfactory line. A thin line is read most accurately. If the pen
point is too fine, however, the ink does not flow readily, and the point
should be slightly blunted by means of a file. More often the line is too
broad and the pen must be carefully pointed. Occasionally the pen does not
touch the sheet, and it becomes necessary to bend the hand slightly. This
is a frequent difficulty if the records are folded or wrinkled, and consequently
the sheets should always be kept flat.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><b>69. The weekly visit.</b> Psychrographs must be visited, checked, rewound,
and inked every week. Whenever possible this should be done regularly
at a specified day and hour. This is especially desirable if the same record
sheet is used for more than one week. Time and energy are saved by a fixed
order for the various tasks to be done at each visit. After opening the
instrument the disk is removed, and the clock wound, and, if need be, regulated.
The record sheet is replaced, the disk again put on the clock arbor,
and the pen replenished with a drop of ink. A psychrometer reading is
made, and the results in terms of relative humidity noted at the proper
place on the disk sheet. If the psychrograph vary more than 1 per cent, it
is adjusted to read accurately. In practice it has been found a great convenience
to keep each record sheet in position for three weeks, and the
time may easily be extended to four. In this event, the pen is carefully
cleaned with blotting paper at each visit, and is then refilled with an ink
of different color. To prevent confusion, the three different colored inks
are always used in the same order, red for the first week, blue for the second,
and green for the third. The advantages of this plan are obvious: fewer
records are used and less time is spent in changing them. The records of
several weeks are side by side instead of on separate sheets, and in working
over the season’s results, it is necessary to handle but a third as many
sheets.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Draper psychrograph is made by the Draper Manufacturing Company,
152 Front St., New York city. The price is $30. A few record
sheets and a bottle of red ink are furnished with it. Additional records can
be obtained at 3 cents each. The inks are 25–50 cents per bottle, depending
upon the color.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Humidity Readings and Records</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>70. The time of readings.</b> If simple instruments alone are used for
determining humidity, readings are practically without value unless made
simultaneously through several stations, or successively at one. When it is
possible to combine these, and to make psychrometer readings at different
habitats for each hour of the day, or at the same hour for several days, the
series is of very great value. Single readings are unreliable on account of
the hourly and daily variations of humidity, but when these changes are
recorded by a psychrograph, such readings at once become of use, whether
made in the same habitat with the recording instrument or elsewhere. In
the latter case, one reading will tell little about the normal humidity of the
habitat, but several make a close estimate possible. When a series of
psychrographs is in use, accurate observations can be made to advantage
anywhere at any time. As a rule, however, it has been found most convenient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>to make simple readings at 6:00 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, 1:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, and 6:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, as
these hours afford much evidence in regard to the daily range. A good time
also is that at which the temperature maximum occurs each day, but this is
movable and in the press of field work can rarely be taken advantage of. A
very fair idea of the daily mean humidity is obtainable by averaging the
readings made at the hours already indicated. The comparison of single
readings with the psychrograph record should not be made at a time when
a rapid change is occurring, as the automatic instrument does not respond
immediately. Such a condition is usually represented by a sudden rain, and
is naturally not a satisfactory time for single readings in any event.</p>

<div  class='figright id001'>
<img src='images/fig_09.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 9. Atmometer.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>71. Place and height.</b> As stated above, the psychrograph
is placed three feet above the surface of
the ground in making readings for the comparison
of stations. In low, herbaceous formations, the instrument
is usually placed within a few inches of the
soil in order to record the humidity of the air in
which the plants are growing. In forest formations,
the moisture often varies considerably in the different
layers. This variation is easily determined by
simultaneous psychrometer readings in the several
layers, or, if occasion warrants, a series of psychrographs
may be used. In field work the rule has been
to make observations with the psychrometer at 6
feet, 3 feet, and the surface of the soil, but the reading
at the height of 3 feet is ordinarily sufficient.
Humidity varies so easily that several readings in
different parts of one formation are often desirable.
In comparing different formations, the readings
should be made in corresponding situations, for example,
in the densest portion of each.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>72. Check instruments.</b> Humidity is so readily
affected by temperature, wind, and pressure, that
a knowledge of these factors is essential to an understanding
of its fluctuations. Pressure, disregarding daily variation,
is taken account of in the tables for ascertaining relative humidity,
and is determined once for all when the altitude of a station has
been carefully established. The temperature is obtained directly from the
dry bulb reading. Its value is fundamental, as the amount of moisture in
a given space is directly affected by it; like pressure, it also is taken account
of in the formula. The movement of the air has an immediate influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>upon moisture by mixing the air of different habitats and layers. So far
as the plant is concerned, it has practically the effect of increasing or decreasing
the humidity by the removal of the air above it. Thus, while the
anemometer can furnish no direct evidence as to the amount of variation,
it is of aid in explaining the reason for it. Likewise, the rate of evaporation
as indicated by a series of atmometers, affords a ready method of estimating
the comparative effect of humidity in different habitats. Potometers
and other instruments for measuring transpiration throw much light upon
humidity values. Since they are concerned with the response of the plant
to humidity, they are considered in the following chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>73. Humidity tables.</b> To ascertain the relative humidity, the difference
between the wet and dry bulb readings is obtained. This, with the dry bulb
temperature, is referred to the tables, where the corresponding humidity is
found. A variation in temperature has less effect than a variation in the
difference; in consequence, the dry bulb reading is expressed in the nearest
unit, and the difference reckoned to the nearest .5. The humidity varies with
the air pressure. Hence, the altitude must be determined for the base station,
and for all others that show much change in elevation. Within the ordinary
range of growing-period temperatures, the effect of pressure is not great.
For all ordinary cases, it suffices to compute tables for pressures of 30, 29,
27, 25, and 23 inches. The following table indicates the decrease in pressure
which is due to altitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fluctuations of pressure due to weather are usually so slight that
their influence may be disregarded. An excellent series of tables of relative
humidity is found in Marvin’s Psychrometric Tables, published by the U. S.
Weather Bureau, and to be obtained from the Division of Publications,
Washington, D. C., for 10 cents. A convenient field form is made by removing
the portion containing the tables of relative humidity, and binding it in

<p class='c007'><b>74. Sums, means, and
curves.</b> An approximate humidity
sum can be obtained
by adding the absolute humidities
for each of the
twenty-four hours, and expressing
the results in grains
per cubic foot. It is possible
to establish a general ratio
between this sum and the
transpiration sum of the
plant, but its value is not
great at present. Means of
absolute and of relative humidity
are readily determinable
from the psychrograph
records; the latter are the
most useful. The mean of
relative humidity for the
twenty-four hours of a day
is the average of the twenty-four
hour humidities.
From these means the seasonal
mean is computed in
the same manner. A close
approximation, usually within
1 degree, may be obtained
in either case by averaging
the maximum and minimum
for the period concerned.
Various kinds of curves are
of value in representing
variation in humidity. Obviously,
these must be
derived from the psychrograph,
or from the psychrometer
when the series is
sufficiently complete. The
level curve indicates the
variation in different stations
at the same time.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>These may be combined in a series for the comparison of readings made at
various heights in the stations. The day or point curve shows the fluctuations
during the day of one point, and the station curve the variation at different
heights in the same station. The curves of successive days or of different
stations may of course be combined on the same sheet for comparison. Level
and station curves based upon mean relative humidities are especially
valuable.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>75. Records.</b> A field form is obviously unnecessary for the psychrograph.
The record sheets constitute both a field and permanent record. The altitude
and other constant features of the station and the list of species, etc.,
are entered on the back of the first record sheet, or, better, they are noted
in the permanent formation record. For psychrometer readings, whether
single or in series, the following record form is employed:</p>

<h3 class='c015'>LIGHT</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>76. Methods.</b> All methods for measuring light intensity, which have been
at all satisfactory, are based upon the fact that silver salts blacken in the light.
The first photographic method was proposed by Bunsen and Roscoe in 1862;
this has been taken up by Wiesner and variously modified. After considerable
experiment by the writer, however, it seemed desirable to abandon all
methods which require the use of “normal paper” and “normal black” and to
develop a simpler one. As space is lacking for a satisfactory discussion of
the Bunsen-Roscoe-Wiesner methods, the reader is referred to the works
cited below.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Simple photometers for making light readings simultaneously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>or in series were constructed in 1900, and have been in constant use since
that time. An automatic instrument capable of making accurate continuous
records proved to be a more difficult problem. A sunshine recorder was ultimately
found which yields valuable results, and very recently a recording
photometer which promises to be perfectly satisfactory has been devised.
Since the hourly and daily variations of sunlight in the same habitat are
relatively small, automatic photometers are perhaps a convenience rather than
a necessity.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>The Photometer</em></h4>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig_11.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 11. Photometer, showing front and side view.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>77. Construction.</b> The simple form of photometer shown in the illustration
is a light-tight metal box with a central wheel upon which a strip of
photographic paper is fastened. This wheel is revolved by the thumbscrew
past an opening 6 mm. square which is closed by means of a slide
working closely between two flanges. At the edge of the opening, and
beneath the slide is a hollow for the reception of a permanent light standard.
The disk of the thumbscrew is graduated into twenty-five parts,
and these are numbered. A line just beneath the opening coincides with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the successive lines on the disk, and indicates the number of the exposure.
The wheel contains twenty-five hollows in which the click works, thus moving
each exposure just beyond the opening. The metal case is made in
two parts, so that the bottom may be readily removed, and the photographic
strip placed in position. The water-photometer is similar except that
the opening is always covered with a transparent strip and the whole instrument
is water-tight. These instruments have been made especially for
measuring light by the C. H. Stoelting Co., 31 W. Randolph street,
Chicago, Ill. The price is $5.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>78. Filling the photometer.</b> The photographic paper called “solio” which
is made by the Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, N. Y., has proved
to be much the best for photometric readings. The most convenient size is
that of the 8 × 10 inch sheet, which can be obtained at any supply house
in packages of a dozen sheets for 60 cents. New “emulsions,” i. e., new
lots of paper, are received by the dealers every week, but each emulsion can
be preserved for three to six months without harm if kept in a cool, light-tight
place. Furthermore, all emulsions are made in exactly the same way,
and it has been impossible to detect any difference in them. To fill the
photometer, a strip exactly 6 mm. wide is cut lengthwise from the 8 × 10
sheet. This must be done in the dark room, or at night in very weak light.
The strip is placed on the wheel, extreme care being taken not to touch the
coated surface, and fixed in position by forcing the free ends into the slit
of the wheel by a piece of cork 8–9 mm. long. The wheel is replaced in
the case, turned until the zero is opposite the index line, and the instrument
is ready for use.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>79. Making readings.</b> An exposure is made by moving the slide quickly
in such a way as to uncover the entire opening, and the standard if the
exposure is to be very short. Care must be taken not to pull the slide entirely
out of the groove, as it will be impossible to replace it with sufficient
quickness. The time of exposure can be determined by any watch after a
little practice. It is somewhat awkward for one person to manage the slide
properly when his attention is fixed upon a second hand. This is obviated
by having one observer handle the watch and another the photometer, but
here the reaction time is a source of considerable error. The most satisfactory
method is to use a stop-watch. This can be held in the left hand
and started and stopped by the index finger. The photometer is held against
it in the right hand in such a way that the two movements of stopping the
watch and closing the slide may be made at the same instant. The length
of exposure is that necessary to bring the tint of the paper to that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>standard beside it. A second method which is equally advantageous and
sometimes preferable does away with the permanent standard in the field
and the need for a stop-watch. In this event, the strip is exposed until a
medium color is obtained, since very light or very deep prints are harder to
match. This is later compared with the multiple standard. In both cases,
the date, time of day, station, number of instrument and of exposure, and
the length of the latter in seconds are carefully noted. The instrument is
held with the edge toward the south at the level to be read, and the opening
uppermost in the usual position of the leaf. When special readings are
desired, as for isophotic leaves, reflected light, etc., the position is naturally
changed to correspond. In practice, it is made an invariable rule to move
the strip for the next exposure as soon as the slide is closed. Otherwise
double exposures are liable to occur. When a strip is completely exposed
it is removed in the dark, and a new one put in place. The former is carefully
labeled and dated on the back, and put away in a light-tight box in a
cool place.</p>

<p>Fig. 12. Dawson-Lander sun recorder.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>80. The Dawson-Lander sun recorder.</b> “The instrument consists of a
small outer cylinder of copper which revolves with the sun, and through
the side of which is cut a narrow slit to allow the sunshine to impinge on
a strip of sensitive paper, wound round a drum which fits closely inside the
outer cylinder, but is held by a pin so that it can not rotate. By means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>a screw fixed to the lid of the outer cylinder, the drum holding the sensitive
paper is made to travel endwise down the outer tube, one-eighth of an
inch daily, so that a fresh portion of the sensitive surface is brought into
position to receive the record.” The instrument is driven by an eight-day
clock placed in the base below the drum. The slit is covered by means of
a flattened funnel-shaped hood, and the photographic strip is protected
from rain by a perfectly transparent sheet of celluloid. The detailed structure
of the instrument is shown in figure 12. This instrument may be obtained
from Lander and Smith, Canterbury, England, for $35.</p>

<p class='c007'>In setting up the sunshine recorder, the axis should be placed in such a
position that the angle which it makes with the base is the same as the
altitude of the place where the observations are made. This is readily done
by loosening the bolts at either side. The drum is removed, the celluloid
sheet unwound by means of the key which holds it in place, the sensitive
strip put in position, and the sheet again wound up. Strips of a special sensitive
paper upon which the hours are indicated are furnished by the makers
of the instrument, but it has been found preferable to use solio strips in
order to facilitate comparison with the standards. The drum is placed on
the axis, and is screwed up until it just escapes the collar at the top of the
spiral. The clock is wound and started, and the outer cylinder put on so
that the proper hour mark coincides with the index on the front of the base.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a sunshine recorder, the instrument gives a perfect record, in which
the varying intensities are readily recognizable. Since the cylinder moves
one-half inch in an hour, and the slit is .01 of an inch, the time of each
exposure is 72 seconds. This gives a very deep color on the solio paper,
which results in a serious error in making comparisons with the standard.
On account of the hood, diffuse light is not recorded when it is too weak
to cast a distinct shadow. It seems probable that this difficulty will be overcome
by the use of a flat disk containing the proper slit, and in this event
the instrument will become of especial value for measuring the diffuse light
of layered formations. The celluloid sheet constitutes a source of error in
sunlight on account of the reflection which it causes. This can be prevented
by using the instrument only on sunny days, when the protection of the
sheet can be dispensed with.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>81. The selagraph.</b> This instrument is at present under construction,
and can only be described in a general way. In principle it is a simple
photometer operating automatically. It consists of a light-tight box preferably
of metal, which contains an eight-day lever clock. Attached to
the arbor of the latter is a disk 7 inches in diameter bearing on its circumference
a solio strip 1 cm. wide and 59 cm. long. The opening in the box
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>for exposure is 6 mm. square and is controlled by a photographic shutter.
The latter is constructed so that it may be set for 5, 10, or 20 seconds, since
a single period of exposure can not serve for both sun and shade. The
shutter is tripped once every two hours, by means of a special wheel revolving
once a day. Each exposure is 6 mm. square, and is separated by a
small space from the next one. Twelve exposures are made every 24 hours,
and 84 during the week, though, naturally, the daytime exposures alone are
recorded. Comparisons with the multiple standard are made exactly as in
the case of the simple photometer. The selagraph is made by the C. H.
Stoelting Co., Chicago, Illinois.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Standards</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>82. Use.</b> The light value of each exposure is determined by reference to
a standard. When the photometer carries a permanent standard, each exposure
is brought to the tint of the latter, and its value is indicated by the
time ratio between them. Thus, if the standard is the result of a 5–second
exposure to full sunlight at meridian, and a reading which corresponds in
color requires 100 seconds in the habitat concerned, the light of the latter
is twenty times weaker or more diffuse. Usually, the standard is regarded
as unity, and light values figured with reference to it, as .05. With the
selagraph such a use of the standard is impossible, and often, also, with the
photometer it is unnecessary or not desirable. The value of each exposure
in such case is obtained by matching it with a multiple standard, after the
entire strip has been exposed. The further steps are those already indicated.
After the exact tint in the standard has been found, the length of the
reading in seconds is divided by the time of the proper standard, and the
result expressed as above.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>83. Making a standard.</b> Standards are obtained by exposing the photometer
at meridian on a typically clear day, and in the field where there is
the least dust and smoke. Exception to the latter may be made, of course,
in obtaining standards for plant houses located in cities, though it is far
better to have the same one for both field and control experiment. Usable
standards can be obtained on any bright day at the base station. Indeed, valuable
results are often secured by immediate successive sun and shade readings
in adjacent habitats, where the sun reading series is the sole standard.
Preferably, standards should be made at the solstices or equinoxes, and at a
representative station. The June solstice is much to be preferred, as it
represents the maximum light values of the year. Lincoln has been taken
as the base station for the plains and mountains. It is desirable, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>that a national or international station be ultimately selected for this purpose,
in order that light values taken in different parts of the world may be
readily compared.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>84. Kinds of standards.</b> The base standard is the one taken at Lincoln
(latitude 41° N.) at meridian June 20–22. This is properly the unit to which
all exposures are referred, but it has been found convenient to employ the
Minnehaha standard as the base for the Colorado mountains, in order to
avoid reducing each time. <em>Relative</em> standards are frequently used for temporary
purposes. Thus, in comparing the light intensities of a series of
formations, one to five standards are exposed on the solio strip before beginning
the series of readings. <em>Proof</em> standards are the exposed solio strips,
which fade in the light, and can, in consequence, be kept only a few weeks
without possibility of error. The fading can be prevented by “toning” the
strip, but in this event the exposures must be fixed in like manner before
they can be compared. This process is inconvenient and time-consuming. It
is also open to considerable error, as the time of treatment, strength of solution,
etc., must be exactly equivalent in all instances. <em>Permanent</em> standards
are accurate water-color copies of the originals obtained by the photometer.
These have the apparent disadvantage of requiring a double comparison or
matching, but after a little practice it is possible to reproduce the solio tints
so that the copy is practically indistinguishable from the original. The most
satisfactory method is to make a long stroke of color on a pure white paper,
since a broad wash is not quite homogeneous, and then to reject such parts
of the stroke as do not match exactly. Permanent standards fade after a
few month’s use, and must be replaced by parts of the original stroke.
<em>Single</em> standards are made by one exposure, while <em>multiple</em> ones have a
series of exposures filling a whole light strip. These are regularly obtained
by making the exposures from 1–10 seconds respectively, and then increasing
the length of each successive exposure by 2 seconds. Single exposures
of 1–5 seconds as desired usually serve as the basis for permanent standards,
but a multiple standard may also be copied in permanent form. Exposures
for securing standards must be made only under the most favorable
conditions, and the length in seconds must be exact. The use of the stop-watch
is imperative, except where access may be had to an astronomical
clock with a large second hand, which is even more satisfactory. The
length of time necessary for the series desired is reckoned beforehand, and
the exposures begun so that the meridian falls in the middle of the process.</p>

<p class='c007'>Single standards are exceedingly convenient in photometer readings, but
they are open to one objection. In the sunshine it is necessary to make instant
decision upon the accuracy of the match, or the exposure becomes too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>deep. In the shade where the action is slower, this difficulty is not felt.
For this reason it is usually desirable to check the results by a multiple standard,
and in the case of selagraph records, where the various exposures show
a wide range of tint, light values are obtainable only by direct comparison
with the multiple standard. The exact matching of exposure and standard
requires great accuracy, but with a little practice this may be done with
slight chance of error by merely moving the exposure along the various
tints of the standard until the proper shade is found. The requisite skill is
soon acquired by running over a strip of exposures several times until the
comparisons always yield the same results for each. The margin of error
is practically negligible when the same person makes all the comparisons,
and in the case of two or three working on the same reading the results
diverge little or not at all. The efficient difference for light is much more
of a variable than is the case with water-content. It has been determined
so far only for a few species, all of which seem to indicate that appreciable
modification in the form or structure of a leaf does not occur until the
reduction in intensity reaches .1 of the meridian sunlight at the June solstice.
The error of comparison is far less than this, and consequently may
be ignored, even in the most painstaking inquiry.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Readings</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>85. Time.</b> The intensity of the light incident upon a habitat varies periodically
with the hour and the day, and changes in accord with the changing
conditions of the sky. The light variations on cloudy days can only be determined
by the photometer. While these can not be ignored, proper comparisons
can be instituted only between the readings taken on normal days
of sunshine. The sunlight varies with the altitude of the sun, i. e., the angle
which its rays make with the surface at a given latitude. This angle reaches
a daily maximum at meridian. The yearly maximum falls on June 22, and
the angle decreases in both directions through the year to a minimum on
December 22. At equal distances from either solstice, the angle is the same,
e. g., on March 21 and September 23. At Lincoln (41° N. latitude) the
extremes at meridian are 73° and 26°; at Minnehaha (39°) they are 75°
and 28°. The extremes for any latitude may be found by subtracting
its distance in degrees north of the two tropics from 90. Thus, the 50th
parallel is 26.5° north of the tropic of Cancer, and the maximum altitude of
the sun at a place upon it is 63.5°. It is 73.5° north of the tropic of Capricorn,
and the minimum meridional altitude is 16.5°.</p>

<p class='c007'>The changes in the amount of light due to the altitude of the sun are produced
by the earth’s atmosphere. The absorption of light rays is greatest
near the horizon, where their pathway through the atmosphere is longest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and it is least at the zenith. The absorption, and, consequently, the relative
intensity of sunlight, can be determined at a given place for each hour of
any sunshiny day by the use of chart 13. This chart has been constructed
for Lincoln, and will serve for all places within a few degrees of the 40th
parallel. The curves which show the altitude of the sun at the various times
of the day and the year have been constructed by measurements upon the
celestial globe. Each interval between the horizontal lines represents 2 degrees
of the sun’s altitude. The vertical lines indicate time before or after
the apparent noon, the intervals corresponding to 10 minutes. If the relative
intensity at Lincoln on March 12 at 3:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> is desired, the apparent
noon for this day must first be determined. A glance at the table shows that
the sun crosses the meridian on this day at 9 minutes 53 seconds past noon at
the 90th meridian. The apparent noon at Lincoln is found by adding 26
minutes 49 seconds, the difference in time between Lincoln and a point on
the 90th meridian. When the sun is fast, the proper number of minutes is
taken from 26 minutes 49 seconds. The apparent noon on March 12 is thus
found to fall at 12:37 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, and 3:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> is 2 hours and 23 minutes later.
The sun’s altitude is accordingly 36°. If the intensity of the light which
reaches the earth’s surface when the sun is at zenith is taken as 1, the table of
the sun’s altitudes gives the intensity at 3:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on March 12 as .85.</p>

<p class='c007'>For places with a latitude differing by several degrees from that of Lincoln,
it is necessary to construct a new table of altitude curves from the
celestial globe. It is quite possible to make a close approximation of this
from the table given, since the maximum and minimum meridional altitude,
and hence the corresponding light intensity, can be obtained as indicated
above. For Minnehaha, which is on the 105th meridian, and for other places
on standard meridians, i. e., 60°, 75°, 90°, and 120° W., the table of apparent
noon indicates the number of minutes to be added to 12 noon, standard time,
when the sun is slow, and to be subtracted when the sun is fast. The time at
a place east or west of a standard meridian is respectively faster or slower
than the latter. The exact difference in minutes is obtained from the difference
in longitude by the equation, 15° = 1 hour. Thus, Lincoln, 96° 42′
W. is 6° 42′ west of the standard meridian of 90°; it is consequently 26 minutes
49 seconds slower, and this time must always be added to the apparent
noon as determined from the chart. At a place east of a standard meridian,
the time difference is, of course, subtracted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The actual differences in the light intensity from hour to hour and day to
day, which are caused by variations in the sun’s altitude, are not as great
as might be expected. For example, the maximum intensity at Lincoln,
June 22, is .98; the minimum meridional intensity December 22 is .73. The
extremes on June 22 are .98 and .33 (the latter at 6:00 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> and 6:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>
approximately); between 8:00 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> and 4:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> the range in intensity is
from .90 to .98 merely. On December 22, the greatest intensity is .52, the
least .20 (the latter at 8:00 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> and 4:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> approximately). If the growing
season be taken as beginning with the 1st of March and closing the 1st of
October, the greatest variation in light intensity at Lincoln within a period of
10 hours with the meridian at its center (cloudy days excepted) is from .33 to
.98. In a period of 8 hours, the extremes are .65 to .98, i. e., the greatest
variation, .3, is far within the efficient difference, which has been put at .9.
For the growing period, then, readings made between 8:00 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> and 4:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>
on normal sunshiny days may be compared directly, without taking into account
the compensation for the sun’s altitude. Until the efficient difference
has been determined for a large number of species, however, it seems wise to
err on the safe side and to compensate for great differences in time of day
or year. In all doubtful cases, the intensity obtained by the astronomical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>method should also be checked by photometric readings. A slight error
probably enters in, due to reflection from the surface of the paper, and to
temperature, but this is negligible.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span><b>87. Place.</b> The effect of latitude upon the sun’s altitude, and the consequent
light intensity have been discussed in the pages which precede. Latitude
has also a profound influence upon the duration of daylight, but the
importance of the latter apart from intensity is not altogether clear. The
variation of intensity due to altitude has been greatly overestimated; it is
practically certain, for example, that the dwarf habit of alpine plants is not
to be ascribed to intense illumination, since the latter increases but slightly
with the altitude. It has been demonstrated astronomically that about 20
per cent of a vertical ray of sunlight is absorbed by the atmosphere
by the time it reaches sea level. At the summit of Pike’s Peak, which is
14,000 feet (4,267 meters) high, the barometric pressure is 17 inches, and
the absorption is approximately 11 per cent. In other words, the light at
sea level is 80 per cent of that which enters the earth’s atmosphere; on the
summit of Pike’s Peak it is 89 per cent. As the effect of the sun’s altitude
is the same in both places, the table of curves on page <a href='#Page_57'>57</a> will apply to
both. Taking into account the difference in absorption, the maximum intensity
at sea level and at 14,000 feet on the fortieth parallel is .98 and 1.09
respectively. The minimum intensities between 8:00 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> and 4:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> of
the growing period are .64 and .71 respectively. The correctness of these
figures has been demonstrated by photometer readings, which have given almost
exactly the same results. Such slight variations are quite insufficient
to produce an appreciable adjustment, particularly in structure. They are
far within the efficient difference, and Reinke<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a> has found, moreover, that
photosynthetic activity in <em>Elodea</em> is not increased beyond the normal in
sunlight sixty times concentrated. In consequence, it is entirely unnecessary
to take account of different altitudes in obtaining light values.</p>

<p class='c007'>The slope of a habitat exerts a considerable effect upon the intensity of
the incident light. If the angle between the slope and the sun’s ray be 90°,
a square meter of surface will receive the maximum intensity, 1. At an
angle of 10°, the same area receives but .17 of the light. This relation between
angle and intensity is shown in the table which follows. The influence
of the light, however, is felt by the leaf, not by the slope. Since there is
no connection between the position of the leaf and the slope of the habitat,
the latter may be ignored. In consequence, it is unnecessary to make allowances
for the direction of a slope, viz., whether north, east, south, or
west, in so far as light values are concerned. The angle which a leaf makes
with its stem determines the angle of incidence, and hence the amount of
light received by the leaf surface. This is relatively unimportant for two
reasons. This angle changes hourly and daily with the altitude of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>sun, and the intensity constantly swings from one extreme to the other.
Moreover, the extremes 1.00 and 0.17, even if constant, are hardly sufficient
to produce a measurable result. When the angle of the leaf approaches 90°,
there is the well-known differentiation of leaf surfaces and of chlorenchym,
but this has no relation to the angle of incidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the sunlight, it makes no difference at what height a light reading is
taken. In forest and thicket as well as in some herbaceous formations, the
intensity of the light, if there is any difference, is greatest just beneath the
foliage of the facies. In forests especially, the light is increasingly diffuse
toward the ground, particularly where layers intervene. In woodland formations,
moreover, the exact spot in which a reading is made must be carefully
chosen, unless the foliage is so dense that the shade is uniform. A
very satisfactory plan is to take readings in two or more spots where the
shade appears to be typical, and to make a check reading in a “sunfleck,”
a spot where sunlight shows through. In forests and thickets, the sunflecks
are fleeting, and the light value is practically that of the shade. In passing
into open woodland and thicket, the sunflecks increase in size and permanence,
until finally they exceed the shade areas in amount and become
typical of the formation.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Reflected and Absorbed Light</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>88. The fate of incident light.</b> The light present in a habitat and incident
upon a leaf is not all available for photosynthesis. Part is reflected or
screened out by the epidermis, and a certain amount passes through the
chlorenchym, except in very thick leaves. The light absorbed is by far the
greatest in the majority of species. Many plants with dense coatings of
hairs reflect or withhold more light than they absorb, and the amount of
light reflected by a thick cuticule is likewise great. As light is imponderable,
the actual amount absorbed or reflected by the leaf can not be determined.
It is possible, however, to express this in terms of the total amount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>received, by means of readings with solio paper, and the knowledge thus
obtained is of great importance in interpreting the modifications of certain
types of leaves. For example, a leaf with a densely hairy epidermis may
receive light of the full intensity, 1; the amount reflected or screened out by
the hairs may be 95 per cent of this, the amount absorbed 5 per cent, and
that transmitted, nil. In the majority of cases, however, the absorbed light
is considerably more than the
amount reflected or transmitted.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>89. Methods of determination.</b>
If results are to be of
value, reflected and transmitted
light must be determined
in the habitat of the plant
simultaneously with the total
light which a leaf receives.
An approximation of the
light reflected from a leaf
surface is secured by placing
the photometer so that the
light reflected is thrown upon
the solio strip. A much more
satisfactory method, however,
is to determine it in connection
with the amount of light
transmitted through the epidermis.
This is done by
stripping a piece of epidermis
from the upper surface of the
leaf and placing it over the
slit in the photometer for an
exposure. An exposure in
the full light of the habitat is made simultaneously with another photometer,
or immediately afterward upon the same strip. When the epidermis is
not too dense, both exposures are permitted to reach the same tint, and the
relation between them is precisely that of their lengths of exposure. Ordinarily
the two exposures are made absolutely simultaneous by placing
the epidermis over half of the opening, leaving the other half to record the
full light value, and the results, or <em>epidermis prints</em>, are referred to a multiple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>standard. The difference between the two values thus obtained represents
the amount of reflected light together with that screened by the epidermis.
The amount of light transmitted through the leaf may be measured
in the same way by using the leaf itself in place of the epidermis alone.
The time of exposure is necessarily long, however, and it has been found
practicable to obtain leaf prints by exposing the leaf in a printing frame,
upon solio paper, at the same time that the epidermis print is made. In a
few species both the upper and lower epidermis can be removed and the
amount of light absorbed determined directly by exposing the strip covered
with the chlorenchym. Generally,
however, this must be computed by
subtracting the sum of the per cents
of reflected and transmitted light
from 100 per cent, which represents
the total light.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>90. Leaf and epidermis prints.</b> In
diphotic leaves the screening effect
of the lower epidermis may be
ignored. Isophotic sun leaves, i. e.,
those nearly upright in position or
found above light-colored, reflecting
soils, are usually strongly illuminated
on both sides, and the absorbed
light can be obtained only by
measuring the screening effect of
both epiderms. Shade leaves and
submerged leaves often contain
chloroplasts in the epidermis, and the
above method can not be applied to
them. In fact, in habitats where the
light is quite diffuse, practically all
incident light is absorbed. The rare
exceptions are those shade leaves with a distinct bloom. In addition to
their use in obtaining the amount of light absorbed, both leaf and epidermis
prints are extremely interesting for the direct comparison of light relations
in the leaves of species belonging to different habitats. The relative screening
value of the upper and lower epidermis, or of the corresponding epiderms
of two ecads or two species, is readily ascertained by exposing the two side
by side in sunshine, over the slit in the photometer. For leaf prints fresh
leaves are desirable, though nearly the same results can be obtained from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>leaves dried under pressure. The leaves are grouped as desired on the glass
of a printing frame, and covered with a sheet of solio. They are then exposed
to full sunlight, preferably at meridian, and the prints evaluated by
means of the multiple standard. This method is especially useful in the
comparison of ecads of one species. These differences due to transmitted
light are very graphic, and can easily be preserved by “toning” the print
in the usual way.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Expression of Results</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>91. Light records.</b> The actual photographic records obtained by photometer
and selagraph can at most be kept but a few months, unless they are
toned or fixed. “Toning” modifies the color of the exposure materially,
and changes its intensity so that it can not be compared with readings not
fixed. It would involve a great deal of inconvenience to make all comparisons
by means of toned strips and standard, even if it were not for the fact
that it is practically impossible to obtain exactly the same shade in lots
toned at different times. The field record, if carefully and neatly made,
may well take the place of a permanent one. The form is the following:</p>

<p class='c007'><b>92. Light sums, means, and curves.</b> Owing to the fact that the selagraph
has not yet been used in the field, no endeavor has been made to determine
the light value for every hour of the day in different habitats.
Consequently there has been no attempt to compute light sums and means.
Photometer readings have sufficed to interpret the effect of light in the
structure of the formation, and of the individual, but they have not been
sufficiently frequent for use in ascertaining sums and means. The latter
are much less valuable than the extremes, especially when the relative duration
of these is indicated. Means, however, are readily obtained from
the continuous records. Light sums are probably impracticable, as the
factor is not one that can be expressed in absolute terms. The various kinds
and combinations of light curves are essentially the same as for humidity.
The level curve through a series of habitats is the most illuminating, but
the day curve of hour variations is of considerable value. The curve of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>daily duration, based upon full sunlight, is also of especial importance for
plants, and stations which receive both sun and shade during the day.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>TEMPERATURE</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>93.</b> In consequence of its indirect action, temperature does not have a
striking effect upon the form and structure of the plant, as is the case
with water and light. Notwithstanding, it is a factor of fundamental importance.
This is especially evident in the character and distribution of
vegetation. It is also seen in the germination and growth of plants, in the
length of season, and in the important influence of temperature upon humidity,
and hence upon water-content. Because of its intimate relation with
the comfort of mankind, the determination of temperature values has received
more attention than that of any other factor, and excellent simple
and recording instruments are numerous. For plants, it is also necessary
to employ instruments for measuring soil temperatures. The latter unquestionably
have much less meaning for the plant than the temperatures
of the air, but they have a direct influence upon the imbibition of water,
and upon germination.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Thermometers</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>94. Air thermometers.</b> The accurate measurement of temperature requires
standard thermometers. Reasonably accurate instruments may be
standardized by determining their error, but they are extremely unsatisfactory
in practice, since they result in a serious waste of time. Accurate
thermometers which read to the degree are entirely serviceable as a rule,
but instruments which read to a fraction of a degree are often very much
to be desired. The writer has found the “cylindrical bulb thermometer,
Centigrade scale” of H. J. Green, to be an exceedingly satisfactory instrument.
The best numbers for general use are 247 and 251, which read from
–15° to 50° C. and are graduated in&#160;.2°. They are respectively 9 and 12
inches long, and cost $2.75 and $3.50. These instruments are delicate and
require careful handling, but even in class work this has proved to be an
advantage rather than otherwise. In making readings of air temperatures
with such thermometers, constant precautions must be taken to expose the
bulb directly to the wind and to keep it away from the hand and person.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>95. Soil thermometers.</b> The thermometer described above has been used
extensively for soil temperatures. The determination of the latter is conveniently
combined with the taking of soil samples, by using the hole for
a temperature reading. When carefully covered, these holes can be used
from day to day throughout the season without appreciable error, even in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>gravel soils. Repeated tests of this have been made by simultaneous readings
in permanent and newly made holes, and the results have always been
the same. It has even been found that the error is usually less than 1 degree
when the hole is left uncovered, if it is more than 9 inches deep. A slight
source of error lies in the fact that the thermometer must be raised to make
the reading. With a little practice, however, the top of the
column of mercury may be raised to the surface and read before
the change of temperature can react upon it. This is
especially important in very moist or wet soils where the bulb
becomes coated with a film of moisture. This evaporates
when the bulb is brought into the air, and after a moment or
two the mercury slowly falls.</p>

<div  class='figright id001'>
<img src='images/fig_16.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 16. Soil thermometer</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Regular soil thermometers are indispensable when readings
are desired at depths greater than 12–18 inches. They
possess several disadvantages which restrict their use almost
wholly to permanent stations. It is scarcely possible to carry
them on field trips, and the time required to place them in
the soil renders them practically useless for single readings.
Moreover, the instruments are expensive, ranging in price
from $7 for the two-foot thermometer, to $19 for the eight-foot
one. When it is recognized that deep-seated temperatures
are extremely constant and that the slight fluctuations
affect, as a rule, only the relatively stable shrubs and trees,
it is evident that such temperatures are of restricted importance.
Still, in any habitat, they must be ascertained before
they can well be ignored, though it is unwise to spend much
time and energy in their determination. Soil thermometers
of the form illustrated may be obtained from H. J. Green,
Brooklyn.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>96. Maximum-minimum thermometers.</b> These are used
for determining the range of temperature within a given
period, usually a day. Since they are much cheaper than
thermographs, they can replace these in part, although they
merely indicate the maximum and minimum temperatures for
the day, and do not register the time when each occurs. The
maximum is a mercurial thermometer with a constriction in the tube just
above the bulb; this allows the mercury to pass out as it expands, but
prevents it from running back, thus registering the maximum temperature.
The minimum thermometer contains alcohol. The column carries a tiny
dumbbell-shaped marker which moves down with it, but will not rise as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the liquid expands. This is due to the fact that the fluid expands too
slowly to carry the marker upward, while the surface tension causes it to
be drawn downward as the fluid contracts. The minimum temperature
is indicated by the upper end of the marker. In setting up the thermometers,
they are attached by special thumbscrews to a support which holds
them in an oblique position. The minimum is placed in a special holder
above the maximum
which rests
on a pin that is
used also for
screwing the pivot-screw
into position.
The support
is screwed
tightly to the cross-piece of a post, or in forest formations it is fastened directly
to a board nailed upon a tree trunk. A shelter has not been used in
ecological work, although it is the rule in meteorological observations. The
minimum thermometer is set for registering by raising the free end, so
that the marker runs to the end of the column. The mercury of the maximum
is driven back into the bulb by whirling it rapidly on the pivot-screw
after the pin has been taken out. This must be done with care in order
that the bulb may not be
broken. As soon as the instrument
comes to rest, it
is raised and the pin replaced,
great care being
taken to lift it no higher
than is necessary. When
the night maximum is
sought, the thermometer
should be whirled several
times in order to drive the
column sufficiently low.
Usually, in such cases, a record is made of this point to make sure that
the maximum read is the actual one. If the pivot-screw is kept well oiled,
less force will be required to drive the mercury back. In practice, the
thermometers have been observed at 6:00 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> and 6:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> each day,
thus permitting the reading of the maximum-minimum for both day and
night. Pairs of maximum-minimum thermometers are to be obtained from
H. J. Green, 1191 Bedford Ave., Brooklyn, or Julien P. Friez, Baltimore,
Maryland, at a cost of $8.25.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>97. Radiation thermometers.</b> These are used to determine the radiation
in the air, and from the soil, i. e., for solar and terrestrial radiation. The
latter alone has been employed in the study of habitats, chiefly for the
purpose of ascertaining the difference in the cooling of different soils at
night. The terrestrial radiation thermometer is merely a special form of
minimum thermometer, so
arranged in a support that
the bulb can be placed directly
above the soil or plant
to be studied. It is otherwise
operated exactly like
the minimum thermometer,
and the reading gives the
minimum temperature which
the air above the plant or
soil reaches, <em>not</em> the amount
of radiation. As a consequence,
these instruments
are valuable only where
read in connection with a
pair of maximum-minimum
thermometers in the air, or
when read in a series of instruments
placed above different
soils or plants.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>98. Thermographs.</b> Two
types of standard instruments
are in general use
for obtaining continuous
records of air temperatures.
These are the Draper thermograph, made by the Draper Manufacturing
Company, 152 Front St., New York city ($25 and $30), and the Richard
thermograph sold by Julien P. Friez, Baltimore ($50). After careful
trial had demonstrated that they were equally accurate, the matter of cost
was considered decisive, and the Draper thermograph has been used exclusively
in the writer’s own work. This instrument closely resembles the
psychrograph manufactured by the same company. It is made in two sizes,
of which the larger one is the more satisfactory on account of the greater
distance between the lines of the recording disk. The thermometric part
consists of two bimetallic strips, the contraction and expansion of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>are communicated to a hand carrying a pen. The latter traces a line on the
record sheet which is attached to a metal disk made to revolve by an eight-day
clock. In practice the thermograph is set up in the shelter which contains
the psychrograph, and in exactly the same manner. The clock is
wound, the record put in place, and the pen inked in the same way also.
The proper position of the pen is determined by making a careful thermometer
reading under the
shelter, and then regulating
the pen hand by means
of the screws at the base
of it. A similar test reading
is also made each
week, when the clock is rewound.
A record sheet
may be left in position for
three weeks, the pen being
filled each week with a different ink.
The fixed order
of using the inks is red,
blue, and green as already
indicated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Owing to the fact that
they are practically stationary,
soil thermographs are
of slight value, except at
base stations. Here, the
facts that they are expensive,
that the soil temperatures
are of relatively little
importance, and that
they can be determined as
easily, or nearly so, by simple thermometers, make the use of such instruments
altogether unnecessary, if not, indeed, undesirable. In a perfectly
equipped research station, they undoubtedly have their use, but at ordinary
stations, and in the case of private investigators, their value is in no wise
commensurate with their cost.</p>

  <h4 class='c018'><em>Readings</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>99. Time.</b> The hourly and daily fluctuations of the temperature of the
air render frequent readings desirable. It is this variation, indeed, which
makes single readings, or even series of them, inconclusive, and renders
the use of a recording instrument almost imperative in the base station at
least. Undoubtedly, a set of simultaneous readings at different heights in
one station, or at the same height in different stations, especially if made
at the maximum, have much value for comparison, but their full significance
is seen only when they are referred to a continuous base record. Such
series, moreover, furnish good results for purposes of instruction. In research
work, however, it has been found imperative to have thermographs
in habitats of widely different character. With these as bases, it is possible
to eke them out with considerable satisfaction by means of maximum-minimum
thermometers in less different habitats, or in different parts of
the same habitat. Naturally these are less satisfactory, and are used only
when expense sets a limit to the number of thermographs. In a careful
analysis of a single habitat, more can be gained by one base thermograph
supplemented by three pairs of maximum-minimum thermometers in dissimilar
areas of the habitat than by two thermographs, and the cost is the
same.</p>

thermometer readings are made at a height of 3 feet (1 meter). Soil temperatures
are regularly taken at the surface and at a depth of 1 foot.
When a complete series of simultaneous readings is made in one station,
the levels are 6 feet and 3 feet in the air, the surface of the soil, and 5,
10, and 15 inches in the soil. When sun and shade occur side by side in
the same formation, as is true of many thickets and forests, surface readings
are regularly made in both. Similarly, valuable results are obtained
by making simultaneous readings on the bare soil, on dead cover, and upon
a leaf, while the influence of cover is readily ascertained by readings upon
it and beneath it. A full series of station readings made at the same time
upon north, east, south, and west slopes is of great importance in studying
the effects of exposure.</p>

the temperature of a particular hour and day can not be read at a
mere glance, it can be obtained so easily that it is a waste of time to make

<p class='c007'><b>102. Temperature sums and means.</b> The amount of heat, i. e., the number
of calories received within a given time by a definite area of plant surface,
can be determined by means of a calorimeter. From this the temperature
sum of a particular period may be obtained by simple addition. In
the present condition of our knowledge, it is impossible to establish any
exact connection between such results and the functional or growth effect
that can be traced directly to heat. As a consequence, temperature sums
do not at present contribute anything of value to an understanding of the
relation between cause and effect. The mean daily temperature is readily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>obtained by averaging twenty-four hour-temperatures recorded by the thermograph.
The method employed by Meyen<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a>, of deriving the mean
directly from the maximum and minimum for the day, is not accurate; from
a large number of computations, the error is always more than two degrees.
On the other hand, the mean obtained by averaging the maximum and
minimum for the day and night has been found to deviate less than 1 degree
from the mean proper. This fact greatly increases the value of maximum-minimum
instruments if they are read daily at 6:00 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> and 6:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><b>103. Temperature curves.</b> The kinds and combinations of temperature
curves are almost without number. The simple curves of most interest
are those for a series of stations or habitats, based upon the level of three
feet, or the surface, or the daily mean. The curves for each station representing
the different heights and depths and the season curve of the daily means
for a habitat are also of much importance. One of the most illuminating
combinations is that which groups together the various level curves for a
series of habitats. Other valuable combinations are obtained by grouping
the curves of daily means of different habitats for the season, or the various
station curves.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>104. Plant temperatures.</b> The direct effects of temperature as seen in
nutrition and growth can be ascertained only by determining the temperature
of plant tissues. The temperatures of the air and of the soil surface
have an important effect upon humidity, and water-content, and through
them upon the plant, but heat can influence assimilation, for example, only in
so far as it is absorbed by the assimilating tissue. The temperatures of
the leaf, as the most active nutritive organ of the plant, are especially important.
While it is a well-known fact that internal temperatures follow
those of the air and soil closely, though with varying rapidity of response,
this holds less for leaves than for stems and roots. Owing to the very
obvious difficulties, practically nothing has yet been done in this important
field. A few preliminary results have been obtained at Minnehaha, which
serve to show the need for such readings. Gravel slide rosettes in an air
temperature of 24° C. and a surface temperature of 40° C. gave the following
surface readings: <em>Parmelia</em>, 40°, <em>Eriogonum</em>, 38.6°, <em>Arctostaphylus</em>,
35°, <em>Thlaspi</em>, 31.8°, and <em>Senecio</em>, 31°. The leaf of <em>Eriogonum flavum</em>,
which is smooth above and densely hairy below, indicated a temperature of
31.8° when rolled closely about the thermometer bulb with the smooth surface
out, and 28° when the hairy surface was outside. The surface readings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of the same leaf were .5°–1° higher when made upon the upper smooth
surface. This immediately suggests that the lower surface may be modified
to protect the leaf from the great heat of the gravel, which often reaches
50° C. (122° F.).</p>

<h3 class='c015'>PRECIPITATION</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>105. General relations.</b> As the factor which exerts the most important
control upon water-content and humidity, rainfall must be carefully considered
by the ecologist. It is such an obvious factor, and is usually spoken
of in such general terms that the need of following it accurately is not evident
at once. When it is recognized that the fluctuations of water-content
are directly traceable to it, it becomes clear that its determination is as
important as that of any indirect factor. This does not mean, however,
that the amount of yearly rainfall is to be taken from the records of the
nearest weather station, and the factor dismissed. Like other instruments,
the rain gauge must be kept at the base station of the area under study,
and when this is extensive or diverse, additional instruments should be
put into commission. While the different parts of the same general climatic
region may receive practically the same amount of precipitation during
the year, it is not necessarily true that the rainfall of any particular
storm is equally distributed, especially in the mountains. Nothing less
than an exact knowledge of the amount of rain that falls in the different
areas will make it possible to tell how much of the water-content found at
any particular time in these represents merely the chance differences of
precipitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The forms of precipitation are rain, dew, hail, snow, and frost. Of
these, hail is too infrequent to be taken into account, while frost usually
occurs only at the extremes of the growing season, and in its effect is
rather to be reckoned with temperature. Snow rarely falls except during
the period of rest, and, while it plays an important part as cover, it is
merely one of several factors that determine the water-content of the soil at
the beginning of spring. The influence of dew is not clearly understood. It
is almost always too slight in amount and too fleeting to affect the water-content
of the soil. It seems probable that it may serve by its own evaporation
to decrease in some degree the water loss from the soil, and from bedewed
plants. If, however, the dew is largely formed by the water of the
soil and of the plant, as is thought by some, then it is negligible as a reinforcement
of water-content. From the above, it is evident that rainfall
alone exerts a profound effect upon the habitat, and it is with its measurement
that the ecologist is chiefly concerned.</p>

<p>Fig. 22. Rain gauge showing construction.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>106. The rain gauge</b>, as the illustration shows, is a cylindrical vessel with
a funnel-shaped receiver at the top, which is 8 inches in diameter. The receiver
fits closely upon a narrower brass vessel or measuring tube in which
the rain collects. The ratio of surface between receiver and tube is 10 to 1.
For readings covering a general area, the rain-gauge is placed in the open,
away from buildings or other obstructions, and is sunken in the ground sufficiently
to keep it upright. In localities where winds are strong, it is usually
braced at the sides also or supported by a wooden frame. In measuring
the amount of rain in the measuring tube, the depth is divided by ten in
order to ascertain the actual rainfall. The depth is measured by inserting
the measuring-rod through the hole in the funnel until it touches the bottom.
It is left for a second or so, quickly withdrawn, and the limit of the
wetted portion noted. In the case of standard rods, the actual rainfall is
read directly in hundredths, so that the division by ten is unnecessary.
After each reading, the measuring tube is carefully drained, replaced, and
the receiver put in position. No regular time for making readings is necessary.
During a rainy period, it is customary to make a measurement each
day, but it has been found more satisfactory for ecological purposes to
measure each shower, and to record its duration. These two facts furnish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>a ready clue to the relative amount of run-off in each fall of rain. The
measurement of snowfall is often made merely by determining its depth.
For comparison with rainfall, the rain gauge with receiver and tube withdrawn
is used. The snow which falls is melted, poured into the measuring
tube, and measured in the ordinary way. The U. S. Weather Bureau
standard rain gauge, with measuring stick, may be obtained of H. J. Green,
or of J. P. Friez for $5.25.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>107. Precipitation records.</b> From the periodic character of precipitation,
rainfall sums, means, and curves have little importance in the careful study
of the habitat. The rainfall curve for the growing season is an aid in explaining
the curve of water-content, and the mean rainfall of a region gives
some idea of its vegetation, though even here the matter of its distribution
is of primary importance. The rain and snow charts published by the U. S.
Weather Bureau furnish data of some importance for the general study
of vegetation, but it is evident that they can play little part in a system
which is founded upon the habitat. Precipitation records, for reasons of
brevity and convenience, are united with wind records, and the form will
be found under the discussion of this factor.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>WIND</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>108. Value of readings.</b>
On account of its
direct effect upon humidity,
and its consequent
influence upon
water-content, the part
which wind plays in a
habitat can not be
ignored in a thorough
investigation. It is an
important element in exposure,
and accordingly
has a marked mechanical
effect upon the vegetation
of exposed habitats,
alpine slopes, seacoasts,
plains, etc.
Owing to its inconstancy and its extreme variation in velocity, single wind
readings are absolutely without value. When read in series, anemometers
give some information upon the comparative air movement in different habitats,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>but the chance of error is great, except when the breeze is steady.
Anemographs alone give real satisfaction. Accurate results, however, are not
obtainable without a series of two or more in different habitats, and it is
still an open question whether the results obtained justify the expense. For
a completely equipped base station, anemometer, anemograph, and wind
vane are desirable instruments, but the study of the habitat has by no
means reached the stage of precision in which their general use is
necessary.</p>

<p>Fig. 24. Standard anemometer.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>109. The anemometer</b> in its simplest form is adapted only to readings
made under direct observation, as a sudden change in the direction of the
wind reverses the movement
of the indicator
needle. This simple wind
gauge, shown in figure
23, has been used for instructional
purposes, and
to a slight extent, also, in
ascertaining the effect of
cover. In constant winds,
successive single readings
are found to have value,
but, ordinarily, the observations
must be simultaneous.
Careful tests of this
simple instrument show that
it is essentially accurate.
It may be obtained from
the C.H. Stoelting Company,
31 W. Randolph St.,
Chicago, for $25. The
standard anemometer
(Fig. 24) is practically a
recording instrument up to 1,000 miles, but as the dials run on without
any indication of the total number of revolutions, it must be visited and
read each day. This renders its use difficult for habitats which are some
distance apart. When exact determinations of wind values become necessary,
the most successful method is to establish a series of three standard
anemometers. One of these should be placed upon the most exposed part
of a typically open habitat, the second in the most protected part of the
same habitat, while the third is located in the midst of a representative
forest formation. If the two habitats are close together, the daily visits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>can be made without serious inconvenience. The reading of the registering
dials requires detailed explanation, and for this the reader is referred
to the printed directions which accompany the instrument. In setting up
the anemometer it must be borne in mind that the ecologist desires the wind
velocity for a particular habitat. In consequence, the precautions which the
meteorologist takes to place the instrument at a certain height and well
away from surrounding obstructions do not hold here. Standard anemometers
are furnished by H. J. Green, and J. P. Friez for $25 each.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anemograph is an anemometer electrically connected with an automatic
register. It is the only instrument adapted to continuous weekly
records in different habitats, but the price, $75 ($25 for the anemometer
and $50 for the register) is practically prohibitive, at least until a complete
series of ecographs for other factors has been obtained.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>SOIL</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>111. Soil as a factor.</b> In determining the value of the soil as a factor in
a particular habitat, it must be clearly recognized that its importance lies
solely in the control which it exerts upon water-content and nutrient-content.
The former is directly connected with the texture or fineness of the
soil, the latter with its chemical nature. Accordingly, the structure of the
soil and its chemical composition are the fundamental points of attack.
These are not at all of equal value, however. Water is both a food, and a
solvent for the nutrient salts of the soil. Furthermore, the per cent of soluble
salts, as determined in mechanical analyses, is practically the same for
all ordinary soils. Indeed, the variations for the same soil types are as
great as for entirely different types. For these reasons, soluble salt-content
may be ignored except where it is readily seen to be excessive, as in
alkaline soils; and determinations of chemical composition are necessary
only in those soils which contain salts or acids to an injurious degree, e. g.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>alkaline soils, peat bogs, humus swamps, etc. The structure of the soil,
on the other hand, in the usual absence of excessive amounts of solutes,
absolutely controls the fate of the water that enters the ground, in addition
to its influence upon the run-off. It determines the amount of gravitation
water lost by percolation, as well as the water that can be raised by capillarity.
The resultant of these, the total soil water or holard, is hence an
effect of structure, while the size and compactness of the particles are conclusive
factors in controlling the chresard. It must be recognized, however,
that these are all factors which enable us to interpret the amount of
holard or chresard found in a particular soil. They have no direct important
effect upon the plant, but influence it only in so far as they affect the
water present.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>112. The value of soil surveys.</b> The full appreciation of the preeminent
value of water-content, particularly of the chresard, greatly simplifies the
ecological study of soils. The ecologist is primarily concerned with soil
water only in its relation to the plant, and while a fair knowledge of soil
structure is essential to a proper understanding of this, he has little concern
with the detailed study of the problems of soil physics. For the sake of a
proper balance of values, he must avoid the tendency noted elsewhere of
ignoring the claims of the plant, and of studying the soil simply as the seat
of certain physical phenomena. Accordingly, it is felt that mechanical and
chemical analyses, determinations of soluble salt-content, etc., have much
less value than has been commonly supposed. The usual methods of soil
survey, which pay little or no attention to water-content, and none at all to
available water, are practically valueless for ecological research. This statement
does not indicate a failure to appreciate the importance of the usual
soil methods for many agricultural problems, such as the use of fertilizers,
conservation of moisture, etc., though even here to focus the work upon
water-content would give much more fundamental and serviceable results.
For these reasons, slight attention will be paid to methods of mechanical and
chemical analysis. In their stead is given a brief statement of the origin,
structure, and character of soils with especial reference to water-content.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>113. The origin of soils.</b> Rocks form soils in consequence of weathering,
under the influence of physical and biotic factors. Weathering consists of
two processes, disintegration, by which the rock is broken into component
particles of various sizes, and decomposition, in which the rock or its fragments
are resolved into minute particles in consequence of the chemical
disaggregation of its minerals, or of some other chemical change. These
processes are usually concomitant, although, as a rule, one is more evident
than the other. The relation between them is dependent upon the character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>of the rock and the forces which act upon it. Hard rocks, i. e., igneous and
metamorphic ones, as a rule disintegrate more rapidly than they decompose;
sedimentary rocks, on the other hand, tend to decompose more rapidly
than they disintegrate. In many cases the two processes go hand in hand.
This difference is the basis for the distinction, first proposed by Thurmann,
between those rocks which weather with difficulty and those which weather
readily. The former were called dysgeogenous, the latter eugeogenous.
Thurmann restricted the application of the first term to those rocks which
produce little soil, but it seems more logical to apply dysgeogenous to
those in which disintegration is markedly in excess of decomposition, and
eugeogenous to those rocks that break down rather readily into fine soils.
With respect to the general character of the soil formed, rocks are <em>pelogenous</em>,
clay-producing, <em>psammogenous</em>, sand-forming, or <em>pelopsammogenous</em>,
producing mixed clay and sand. The first two are divided into <em>perpelic</em>,
<em>hemipelic</em>, <em>oligopelic</em>, <em>perpsammic</em>, etc., with reference to the readiness with
which they are weathered, but this distinction is not a very practicable
one. The grouping of soils into silicious, calcareous, argillaceous, etc., with
reference to the chemical nature of the original rock, is of no value to the
ecologist, apart from the general clue to the physical properties which it
furnishes.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>114. The structure of soils.</b> The water capacity of a soil is a direct
result of the fineness of the particles. Since the water is held as a thin
surface film by each particle or group of them, it follows that the amount
of water increases with the water-holding surface. The latter increases as
the particles become finer and more numerous, and thus produce a greater
aggregate surface. The upward and downward movements of water in the
soil are likewise in immediate connection with the size of particles. The
upward or capillary movement increases as the particles become finer, thus
making the irregular capillary spaces between them smaller, and magnifying
the pull exerted. On the contrary, the downward movement of gravitation
water, i. e., percolation, is retarded by a decrease in the size of the soil
grains and hastened by an increase. Hence, the two properties, capillarity
and porosity, are direct expressions of the structure of the soil, i. e., of its
texture or fineness. Capillarity, however, increases the water-content of the
upper layers permeated by the roots of the plant, while porosity decreases
it. On the basis of these properties alone, soils would fall into two groups,
capillary soils and porous soils, the former fine-grained and of high water-content,
the latter coarse-grained and with relatively little water. A third
factor, however, of great importance must be taken into account. This is
the pull exerted upon each water film by the soil particle itself. This pull apparently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>increases in strength as the film grows thinner, and explains why it
finally becomes impossible for the root-hairs to draw moisture from the soil.
This property, like capillarity, is most pronounced in fine-grained soils, such
as clays, and is least evident in the coarser sands and gravels. It seems to
furnish the direct explanation of non-available water, and, in consequence,
to indicate that the chresard is an immediate result of soil texture.</p>

<p>Fig. 25. Sieves for soil analysis.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>115. Mechanical analysis.</b> From the above it is evident that, with the
same rainfall, coarse soils will be relatively dry, and fine soils correspondingly
moist. However, this difference in holard is somewhat counterbalanced by
the fact that the chresard is much greater in the former than in the latter.
The basis of these relations can be obtained only from a study of the texture
of the soil. The usual method of doing this is by mechanical analysis.
This is far from satisfactory, since the use of the sieves often brings about
the disaggregation of groups of particles which act as units in the soil.
Furthermore, the analysis affords no exact evidence of the compactness of
the soil in nature, and tests of capillarity and porosity made with soil samples
out of position are open to serious error. Nevertheless, mechanical
analyses furnish results of some value by making it possible to compare soils
upon the basis of texture. For ecological purposes, minute
analyses are undesirable; their value in any work
is doubtful. A separation of soil into gravel, sand, and
silt-clay is sufficient, since the relative proportion of
these will explain the holard and chresard of the soil
concerned. The latter are also affected in rich soils,
especially of forests, by the organic matter present. If
this is in a finely divided condition, the amount is determined
by calcining. When a definite layer of leafmold
is present, as in forests and thickets, its water-value
is found separately, since its power of retaining water is altogether out of
proportion to its weight.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>116. Kinds of soils.</b> It is very doubtful whether it is worth while to attempt
to distinguish soils upon the basis of mechanical analysis. Unquestionably,
the most satisfactory method is to distinguish them with
respect to holard and chresard, and to regard texture as of secondary importance.
A series of soil classes which comprise various soil types has
been proposed by the U. S. Bureau<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a> of Soils as follows: (1) stony loam,
(2) gravel, (3) gravelly loam, (4) dunesand, (5) sand, (6) fine sand,
(7) sandy loam, (8) fine sandy loam, (9) loam, (10) shale loam, (11)
silt loam, (12) clay loam, (13) clay, (14) adobe. These are based
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>entirely upon mechanical analyses, and in some cases are too closely related
to be useful. The line between them can nowhere be sharply drawn. Indeed,
the variation within one class is so great that soils have frequently
been referred to the wrong group. Thus, Cassadaga sand (gravel 22 per
cent, sand 43 per cent, silt 21 per cent, clay 10 per cent) is more closely related
to Oxnard sandy loam (26–37–18–12) and to Afton fine sandy loam
(28–43–18–8) than to Coral sand (61–29–3–4), Galveston sand (6–91–1–1),
or Salt Lake sand (84–15–1–0). Elsinore sandy loam (8–38–35–10)
is much nearer to Hanford fine sandy loam (9–36–33–14) than to
Billings sandy loam (1–60–22–11) or to Utuado sandy loam (48–23–19–8).
The soil types are much more confused, and for ecological purposes
at least are entirely valueless. Lake Charles fine sandy loam has
the composition, 1–34–52–9; Vernon fine sandy loam, 1–37–54–7, while
many other so-called types show nearly the same degree of identity.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>117. The chemical nature of soils.</b> The effect of alkaline and acid substances
in the soil upon water-content and the activities of the plant is
far from being well understood. It is generally recognized that salts and
acids tend to inhibit the absorptive power of the root-hairs. In the case
of saline soils, this inhibitive effect seems to be established, but the action
of acids in bogs and swamps is still an open question. It is probable that
the influence of organic acid has been overestimated, and that the curious
anomaly of a structural xerophyte in a swamp is to be explained by the
stability of the ancestral type and by the law of extremes. Apart from the
effect which excessive amounts of acids and salts may have in reducing
the chresard, the chemical character of the soil is powerless to produce
structural modification in the plant. Since Thurmann’s researches there
has been no real support of the contention that the chemical properties of
the soil, not its physical nature, are the decisive factors in the distribution
and adaptation of plants. It is not sufficient that the vegetation of a
silicious soil differs from that of a calcareous one. A soil can modify the
plants upon it only though its water-content, or the solutes it contains.
Hence, the chemical composition of the original rock is immaterial, except
in so far as it modifies these two factors. Humus, moreover, while an
important factor in growth, has no formative influence beyond that which
it exerts through water-content.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>PHYSIOGRAPHY</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>118. Factors.</b> The physiographic factors of a definite habitat are altitude,
exposure, slope, and surface. In addition, topography is a general though
less tangible factor of regions, while the dynamic forces of weathering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>erosion and sedimentation play a fundamental role in the change of habitats.
It is evident, however, that these, except where they affect the destruction
of vegetation directly, can operate upon the plant only through
more direct factors, such as water, light, and temperature. While they are
themselves not susceptible of measurement, they can often be expressed
in terms of determinable factors, i. e., slope, exposure, and surface. Fundamentally,
they constitute the forces which change one habitat into another,
and, in consequence, are really to be considered as the factors which produce
succession. The static features of physiography, altitude, etc., lend
themselves readily to determination by means of precise instruments. These
factors, though by no means negligible, are remote, and consequently their
mere measurement is insufficient to indicate the nature or extent of their
influence upon the plant. It is necessary to determine also the manner
and degree in which they affect other factors, a task yet to be done.
Readings of altitude, slope, and exposure are so easily made that the student
must carefully avoid the tendency to let them stand at their own
value, which is slight. Instead, they should be made the starting point for
ascertaining the differences which they produce in water-content, humidity
wind, and temperature.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Altitude</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>119. Analysis into factors.</b> Of all physiographic features, altitude is the
most difficult to resolve into simple factors. Because of general geographic
relations, it has a certain connection with rainfall, but this is vague and
inconstant. Obviously, in its influence upon the plant, altitude is really
pressure, and in consequence its effect is exerted upon the climatic and
not the edaphic factors of the habitat. Theoretically, the decrease of air pressure
in the increased altitude directly affects humidity, light, and temperature.
Actually, while there is unquestionably a decrease in the absorption
of the light and heat rays owing to the fact that they traverse
less atmosphere, which is at the same time less dense, this seems to be
negligible. Photometric readings at elevations of 6,000 and 14,000 feet
have so far failed to show more than slight differences, which are altogether
too small to be efficient. The effect upon humidity is greater, but the
degree is uncertain. Continuous psychrographic records at different elevations
for a full season, at least, will be necessary to determine this, since
the psychrometric readings so far made, while referred to a base psychrograph,
are too scattered to be conclusive. Finally, the length of the season,
itself a composite, is directly dependent upon the altitude. This relation,
though obscure, rests chiefly upon the rarefaction of the air which
prevents the accumulation of heat in both the soil and the air.</p>

<p>Fig. 26. Aneroid barometer.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>120. The barometer.</b> To secure convenience and accuracy in the determination
of altitude, it is necessary to use both a mercurial and an
aneroid barometer. The latter is by far the most serviceable for field work,
but it requires frequent standardizing by means of the former. The mercurial
form is much more accurate and should be read daily in the base
station. It is practically impossible to carry it in the field, except in the
so-called mountain form, which is of great service in establishing the altitudes
of a series of stations. In use the aneroid barometer may be checked
daily by the mercurial standard, or it may be set at the altitude of the base
station, thus giving a direct reading. After the normal pressure at the
base has once been ascertained, however, the most satisfactory method is
to set the aneroid each day by the standard, at the same time noting the
pressure deviation in feet of elevation (see
p. <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>). The absolute elevation of the various
stations of a series may be determined
either by adding or subtracting this deviation
from the actual reading at the station,
or by noting the change from the base
station, and then adding or subtracting this
from the normal of the latter. When it is
impossible to check the aneroid by means
of a mercurial barometer, the average of a
series of readings made at different days at
one station, especially if taken during
settled weather, will practically eliminate
the daily fluctuations, and yield a result
essentially accurate. Even in this event,
the accuracy of the aneroid should be
checked as often as possible, since the
mechanism may go wrong at any time. The
barograph, while a valuable instrument for base stations, is not at all necessary.
These instruments can be obtained from all makers of meteorological
apparatus, such as H. J. Green, and J. P. Friez. Aneroid barometers reading
to 16,000 feet cost about $20; the price of the Richards aneroid barograph is
$45. Ordinary observatory barometers cost $30–$40; the standard instrument
sells at $75–$100. The mountain barometer, which is altogether the
most serviceable for the ecologist, ranges from $30–$55, depending upon
accessories, etc.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>121. Concept.</b> This term is used in the ordinary sense to indicate the
relation of the surface of a habitat to the horizon. Although it is a complex
of factors, or rather influences several factors, these are readily determinable.
The primary effect of
slope is seen in the control of run-off
and drainage, and consequently
of water-content, although these
are likewise affected by soil texture
and by surface. Slope, moreover,
as a concomitant of exposure,
has an important bearing upon
light and heat by virtue of determining
the angle of incidence, and
also upon wind, and, through it,
upon the distribution of snow. At
present, while it can be expressed
definitely in degrees, it has not yet
been connected quantitatively with
more direct factors. This is, however,
not a difficult task, and it is
probable that we shall soon come
to express slope principally in
amount of run-off, and of incident
heat.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>122. The clinometer.</b> In the
simplest form, this instrument is
merely a semicircle of paper, with
each half graduated from 1–90°. It
is mounted on a board and placed
base upward, upon a wooden strip,
2 feet long and 2 inches wide,
which has a true edge. At the center
of the circle is attached a line
and plummet for reading the perpendicular.
A more convenient
form is shown in figure 28, which
is both clinometer and compass.
This also necessitates the use of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>basing strip to eliminate the inequalities of the surface. The dial face
is graduated to show inches of rise per yard, as well as the number of degrees,
but the latter, as the simpler term, is preferable for ecological work.
In making a reading, the basing strip is placed upon a representative area
of the slope, and pressed down firmly to equalize slight irregularities. The
clinometer is moved slightly along the upper edge, causing the marker to
swing freely. After the latter comes to rest, the instrument is carefully
turned upon its back, when the angle of the slope in degrees may be read
directly. Two or three such readings in different areas will suffice for the
entire habitat, unless it be extremely irregular. The clinometer with compass
may be obtained from the Keuffel and Esser Company, 111 Madison
St., Chicago, Illinois, for $5.</p>

<p>Fig. 28. Combined clinometer and compass.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>123. The trechometer.</b> For measuring the effect of slope upon run-off,
a simple instrument called the trechometer (τρέχω, to run off) has been
devised. This consists merely of a metal tank, 3 × 4 × 12 inches, holding
144 cubic<a id='t84'></a> inches of water, with an opening ¼ × 12 inches at the base
in front, closed by a tight-fitting slide. Three metal strips, 2 × 12 inches,
are fastened to the front of the tank in such a way as to enclose a square
foot of soil into which the strips penetrate an inch. In the front strip is an
opening, 1 inch square, provided with a drip from which the run-off is
collected in a measuring vessel. In use, the instrument is put in position
with the metal rim forced down 1 inch into the soil; the tank is filled, the
graduate put in place, and the slide raised. The run-off for a square foot
is the amount of water caught by the graduate, and is represented in
cubic inches per square foot. For obtaining results which express slope
alone, comparisons must be made upon the same soil, from which all cover,
dead and living, has been removed. They must be as closely together in
time as possible, at least during the same day, as rain or evaporation will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>cause considerable error. It is obvious that with the same slope or on a
level the trechometer may also be used to advantage to determine the absorptive
power of soils of different texture. It serves well a similar purpose
when used in different habitats to measure the composite action of
slope, soil, and cover in dividing the rainfall into run-off and absorbed
water.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Exposure</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>124. Exposure</b> refers primarily to the direction toward which a slope
faces, i. e., its exposition or insolation with respect to sun and wind. It is
not altogether separable from slope, however, inasmuch as the angle of the
slope has some effect upon the degree of exposure. The chief influence of
exposure is exerted through temperature, since slopes longest exposed to
the sun’s rays receive the most heat. This is supplemented in an important
degree by the fact that a group of rays 1 foot square will occupy this area
only on slopes upon which they fall at right angles. In all other cases the
rays are spread over a longer area, with a consequent reduction in the
amount of heat received. This effect is felt principally in evaporation from
the soil, and in soil temperatures. For the leaf, it is largely if not entirely
negligible, since the angle of incidence is determined by the position of
the leaf, which is the same for each species whether on the level or upon
a slope. On this account, exposure has little or no bearing upon light,
except that the total amount of light received by the aggregate vegetation
of a slope will be greater than for a level area of the same size. The
effect of wind varies with the exposure. It is naturally most pronounced
in those directions from which the prevailing dry or cold winds blow, and
it is greatly emphasized by the fact that the opposite exposure is correspondingly
protected. The influence of wind, especially in producing
evaporation from the plant and the soil, increases with the slope, since
the mutual protection of the plants, or that afforded the soil by the cover,
is much reduced. Finally, the distribution of the snow by the wind, a
matter of considerable importance for early spring vegetation, is largely
determined by exposure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Exposure is expressed directly in terms of direction, to which is added
the angle of the slope. A good field compass, reading to twelve points, is
sufficient. It should be checked, of course, by the declination of the needle
at the place under observation. A convenient instrument is the one already
mentioned, in which compass and clinometer are combined, since these are
regularly used at the same time.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>125. Surface.</b> The most important consideration with respect to surface
is the presence or absence of cover, and the character of the latter. With
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the exception of snow, cover is, however, a question of vegetation, living
and dead, and consequently is to be referred to the discussion of biotic
factors. The surface of the soil itself often shows irregularities which
must be taken into account. Such are the rocks of boulder and rock fields,
the hummocks of meadows and bogs, the mounds of prairie dog towns,
the innumerable minute gullies and ridges of bad lands, the raised tufts
of sand-hills, etc. The influence of these is not profound, but they do
have an appreciable effect upon the run-off, temperature, and wind. In
many cases, this is distinctly measurable, but as a rule little more can be
done than to indicate that the surface is even or uneven, and to describe
the degree and kind of unevenness.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>127. Topography.</b> As heretofore indicated, questions pertaining to the
form and development of the land concern groups of habitats within which
each habitat is the unit of investigation after the manner already laid down.
A knowledge of topography is essential to the accurate mapping of a
region, for which the simple methods of plane table and contour work are
employed, while the geology of the surface is of primary importance in
the study of successions.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>BIOTIC FACTORS</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>128. Influence and importance.</b> Biotic factors are animals and plants.
With respect to influence they are usually remote, rarely direct. Nevertheless,
they often play a decisive part in the vegetation. Their effect is, as
a rule, felt directly by the formation rather than the habitat, but in either
case the one reacts upon the other. Such factors are not themselves susceptible
of exact measurement, but their influence upon the habitat is
usually measurable in terms of the physical factors affected. In the case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>of biotic factors, it must be distinctly understood that these are not properly
factors of the habitat as a physical complex, but that they are rather to be
considered as reactions exerted by the effect, or formation, upon the cause
or habitat. This is most especially true of plants.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>129. Animals.</b> The activities of man fall into two classes: (1) those
that destroy vegetation, and (2) those that modify it. There are rare instances
also where the work of man has changed a new or already denuded
habitat. In the cases where the vegetation is destroyed, the habitat itself
is sufficiently changed to permit the effect to be measured by physical factor
instruments. Otherwise, the influence is felt only by the formation, as when
man makes possible the migration of weeds, and it can be measured in
terms of invasion by the quadrat alone. It becomes especially evident,
then, in the case of man’s activities, that where they produce a denuded
habitat they are to be regarded as factors in the habitat; when they merely
affect the formation, this is not strictly true. The changes wrought by
other animals are essentially the same as those produced by man. They
are not so marked nor so important, but their relation to habitat and formation
is the same. As a rule, however, they affect the habitat much less
than they do the formation.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>130. Plants.</b> As a dead cover, vegetation is a factor of the habitat
proper, but it has relatively little importance, since it occurs regularly during
the resting period. Its chief effects are in modifying soil temperature,
and in holding snow and rain, and thereby increasing the water-content.
By its gradual decay, moreover, it not only adds humus to the soil, but it
thereby increases the water-retaining capacity of the latter also. The
cover of living vegetation reacts upon the habitat in a much more vital
fashion, exerting a powerful effect upon every physical factor of the
habitat. The factors thus affected are distinctly measurable though it is
often impossible to determine just how much of the factor is directly traceable
to the vegetation. This is a simple problem in the case of most aerial
factors, especially light, but it is extremely difficult for soil factors, such
as water-content and soil texture. In the case of all habitats covered with
formations, by far the great majority, it is impossible as well as unnecessary
to separate the physical factors of the habitat proper from the reaction
upon them which the plant covering exerts. Indeed, the great differentiation
of habitats is largely due to the universal principle that in
vegetation the effect or formation always reacts upon the cause or habitat in
such a way as to modify it. As fundamental causes of succession, the discussion
of the various reactions of vegetation is reserved for another place.</p>

  <h4 class='c018'><span class='sc'>Methods of Habitat Investigation</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>131.</b> The use of the various instruments previously described depends
largely upon the preponderance of simple instruments or recording ones.
The former necessitate a number of well-trained assistants; the latter require
only a part of the time of one investigator. For the most satisfactory
results, however, an assistant is all but indispensable. Since simple
instruments are most easily obtained because of their cheapness, and
are especially adapted to purposes of instruction, the method of using them
will be described first, and then that of ecograph batteries.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE METHOD OF SIMPLE INSTRUMENTS</h3>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig_29.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 29. Series of stations: I, at Minnehaha; II, at Lincoln in the prairie formation.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>132. Choice of stations.</b> This method is based upon simultaneous readings
by means of simple instruments in a series of habitats, or of stations
in a single habitat. Such readings are necessary for the variable atmospheric
factors, humidity, light, temperature, and wind. Frequent readings
suffice for water-content and precipitation, while only two or three
determinations, enough to check out the error, are necessary for the constant
factors, altitude, slope, exposure, and surface. An account of the
exact procedure employed in class study at Lincoln and Minnehaha will
best serve to illustrate the use of this method. The series of stations chosen
at Lincoln were primarily within a single formation, for the purpose of
determining the physical factor variation in different areas. One series
was located in the prairie-grass formation (<em>Koelera-Andropogon-psilium</em>),
and consisted of the following stations: (1) low prairie, (2) crest of ridge I,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>(3) northeast slope of ridge I, (4) grassy ravine, (5) southwest slope of
ridge II, (6) bare crest of ridge II, (7) thicket ravine. The other series
was established in the bur-oak-hickory forest (<em>Quercus-Hicoria-hylium</em>)
at the following stations: (1) thicket, (2) woodland, (3) knoll in forest,
(4) depression in forest, (5) level forest floor, (6) nettle thicket, (7) brook
bank. At Minnehaha the series was primarily one of different formations:
(1) the pine formation (<em>Pinus-xerohylium</em>), (2) the gravel slide formation
(<em>Pseudocymopterus-Mentzelia-chalicium</em>), (3) east slope of spruce forest
(<em>Picea-Pseudotsuga-hylium</em>), (4) ridge in the spruce forest, (5) north
slope of spruce forest, (6) brook bank in forest, (7) the thicket formation
(<em>Quercus-Cercocarpus-lochmodium</em>), (8) the aspen formation (<em>Populus-hylium</em>).
When permanent or temporary quadrats are established, they are
ordinarily used as regular stations, since this enables one to refer the
physical factor readings to a few definite individual plants, as well as to the
entire formation. The transects in figure 29 illustrate two of the above
series of stations.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>133. Time of readings.</b> The frequency of simple readings and the
times at which they are made must be regulated largely by opportunity and
convenience. In addition to making readings once or twice a week throughout
the season, the series should be read at least once every day for a representative
week or two. It is also very desirable to have a series for each
hour of a typical day, or of two days, one of which is clear, the other cloudy.
When a single daily reading is made, it should be taken at or as near meridian
as possible. The usual series is the one obtained by simultaneous
observations at the same level in different stations. An important series is
also secured by simultaneous readings at the various levels of the same
station, though it is not necessary to take this series frequently.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 30. A denuded station in the aspen formation.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>134. Details of the method.</b> After the stations have been selected by a
careful preliminary survey of the habitat or series of habitats, their location
is indicated by a small flag bearing a number, in case there is no danger of
these being disturbed. Otherwise, less conspicuous stakes are used. The
ordinary practice is to visit each station of the series, and to take readings
of water-content, altitude, slope, and exposure. On the first trip these are
all made by the instructor, but after a short time the determination of each
factor may be assigned in rotation to each of the students. After these
constant factors have been read and recorded, one student is equipped with
photometer, thermometer, and psychrometer, and, if desirable, anemometer,
and left at the first station. At each succeeding station the same plan is
followed, so that at the end of the series the constant factors have all been
read, and there is an observer at each station prepared to make readings of
the variable ones. The task of acquainting the students with the operation
of photometer, psychrometer, etc., can best be done in class or at a previous
field period, as it is evident that they must be familiar with the instruments
before they can use them accurately in the field series. The details of operation
have already been given and need not be repeated here. The task of
obtaining readings at the same moment may be met by supplying each
observer with a watch, which runs exactly with all the others, or by making
observations upon signal. The second means has been found most successful
in practice, since the signal fixes the attention at the exact moment.
The best plan is for the instructor to occupy a commanding position somewhere
near the middle of the series, and to give the signals by shout or
whistle at the proper interval. Considerable care and experience are necessary
to do the last satisfactorily. Sufficient time must be given for the
operation of the instrument and the making of the record. In addition, a
period must be permitted to elapse which is long enough for every instrument
to reach the proper reading. For example, in a series which contains
a gravel slide and a forest, the thermometer which has just been used for
an air reading will require four or five times as long an interval to respond
to the temperature of the gravel as to that of the cool forest floor. In such
series, the instructor should regularly take his place in the station where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the response is slowest or greatest. He must record the exact time of each
signal, and note any general changes of sky or wind that produce temporary
fluctuations at the time of reading. When the readings extend over a whole
day, the usual plan is to begin at the last station and take a second series of
water-content samples, noting the exact time in order that the rate of water
loss may be determined. A check series of physiographic factors may be
made at this time also, or this may be left for future visits. While it is unnecessary
to take soil samples oftener than once a day, it is important to
make at least one series at each visit. Sometimes it becomes desirable to
know the rate of water loss in different stations during the day, and in this
event, samples are taken at one or two hour intervals for the entire day.</p>

<p class='c007'>In making simultaneous readings at the different levels of one station, the
observers are grouped in one spot in such a way that they do not interfere
with the correct reading of each instrument. Readings of this sort are most
valuable in the case of temperature, which shows greater differences at the
various levels. Important differences of humidity and wind also are readily
obtained, and, in layered formations, marked variations in the amount of
light. In the open, the ordinary levels for temperature are 6 feet, 3 feet,
surface, 5, 10, and 15 inches in the ground, and for wind and humidity, 6
feet, 3 feet, and surface. In forests the same levels are used for comparison
with formations in the open, but a more desirable series for light especially
is secured by making readings at the height of, or better, just below the various
layers. Series of this sort are likewise made on signal. The best time of
day is that of a period in which the middle station is read near meridian,
since the variation due to time is sufficiently small to permit fairly accurate
comparisons between the readings for the different stations.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>135. Records.</b> The form used for recording the observations made by
means of simple instruments is shown below. It is hardly necessary to state
that it may be readily modified to suit the needs of different investigators.
Ordinarily, each sheet is used for the records of one habitat or series alone,
but for convenience sake, the records of two different series are here combined.
The figures given are taken from records for the prairie and forest
formations at Lincoln.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>METHOD OF ECOGRAPH BATTERIES</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>136.</b> A battery of recording instruments consists of a selagraph, a psychrograph,
and a thermograph, to which an anemograph is added when possible.
As stated before, the determination of water-content by the geotome
method is more satisfactory than by any automatic instrument yet devised.
When the base station is located where the sunlight is unobstructed, which
should be the case whenever possible, it is unnecessary to include a selagraph
in those batteries placed in similarly exposed stations, since the light values
will be the same. As a rule, batteries are established within different zones
or different habitats, except where a highly diversified habitat is made the
subject of special inquiry. Such a restriction arises from the fact that expense,
care of operation, etc., place a limit upon the number of batteries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and, in such case, the task of primary importance is to establish the physical
character of representative habitats. For these reasons, the first series of
thermographs established in 1903 was located with respect to altitude, the
instruments being placed at Manitou 2,000 m., Minnehaha, 2,600 m., and
Mount Garfield 3,800 m. In 1904, the stations established for the record of
temperature and humidity were situated with respect to habitats representing
the four formations: gravel slide, half gravel slide, spruce forest, and
brook bank.</p>

<p class='c007'>The batteries are located and set up according to the directions already
given. A 2–meter quadrat with the battery as the middle is staked and
mapped. Within this, all readings of water-content, soil temperature, and
physiographic factors are made. Altitude, slope, exposure, and cover are
recorded when each battery is located, and a soil sample is taken for mechanical
analysis. When the position of the batteries permits it, water-content
readings should be made frequently, once or twice a week at least. In
addition, a complete series of samples should be taken daily for a period
sufficient to indicate the ordinary extremes of water-content.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ecograph battery of each habitat constitutes a standard to which the
results obtained by simple instruments may be referred with accuracy. It
not only does this, but it also serves as a basis for interpreting the readings
of simple instruments in distant habitats of the same character. In this way
a few batteries judiciously placed make possible the exact physical investigation
of a large number of habitats, covering a considerable area. The only
limit, indeed, upon this method is that placed by time. The proportionate
use of batteries and of simple instruments must be largely determined by
the conditions which confront the investigator. It is obvious that, where
expense is not a decisive factor, the gain in time and in completeness of
results is enormously in favor of the battery. There is an additional value
in the automatic and continuous record which can not be overlooked. When
the use of instruments in the study of habitat and formation becomes universal,
the importance of the ecograph will be immeasurably enhanced. It
will be possible to secure duplicate records of batteries located in the most
remote and diverse regions, from the equator to the poles, and comparative
phytogeography upon a scientific basis will for the first time be possible.
This opens an alluring vista of the future when ecologists the world over
will cooperate in such a way that the results obtained by ecograph batteries
anywhere on the globe will permit of exact comparison.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>THE EXPRESSION OF PHYSICAL FACTOR RESULTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>137. The form of results.</b> It is almost inevitable that the general adoption
of precise methods of measuring the habitat will result in a common
form for expressing the physical character of the latter. An actual diagnosis
of each habitat is not a difficult matter, after the factors are carefully
measured, and will unquestionably lead to very desirable definiteness and
precision. The accurate investigation of the physical factors of a number
of habitats for one growing season furnishes the necessary material for a
diagnosis based upon the mean for the growing season. Similar results for
two or three seasons will yield a diagnosis as accurate and as final as that
of a formation, or, indeed, as that of many species. The author’s investigations
have not yet gone far enough to warrant proposing a final form for
this, but the following diagnosis is offered as a suggestion:</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Elymus-Muhlenbergia-chalicium.</em> Habitat: holard 9 per cent, chresard 8
per cent, relative humidity 40 per cent, light 0.6, soil colluvial gravel (gravel
70 per cent, sand 27 per cent, silt 3 per cent), air temperature 65°, surface
82°, soil 59°, wind 10 miles, rainfall 8 inches, altitude 2,800 m., slope 23°,
exposure south, surface even, cover open, no active biotic agencies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The detailed comparison of habitats is made most readily by the graphic
method of curves, which constitute the most desirable form of expression in
connection with the original record upon which they are based. Factor
means are particularly desirable for diagnostic purposes, and they furnish
valuable curves also. Factor sums are impracticable at present, and it seems
doubtful that they will ever be of much value. It is by no means impossible,
however, that a more detailed and exact knowledge of the physiology
of adaptation, coupled with methods of precision in the habitat, will render
them necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Factor Records</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>138.</b> Experience has shown that the practice of making hasty and often
formless records in the field is unwise and is apt to be inaccurate as well. The
time saved in the field is more than counterbalanced by that consumed in
copying the results into the permanent form. The danger of error in field
notes rapidly taken is very grave, and the chance of confusion and the waste
of time in deciphering them are great. Moreover, the task of checking a
copy with the original, which is absolutely necessary for accuracy, involves
a further expenditure of time and energy. For these reasons the field record
should be made in permanent form. Definite record sheets are used, and
the invariable rule is made that all readings are to be noted in ink at the
time and spot where they are taken. On a long journey, or in the face of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>many observations, the tendency to take notes or to record observations
rapidly is very great, but this will correct itself after a few attempts to
use such notes. The record forms for various factors have been indicated
in the proper place, as well as the one for simultaneous readings. Ecograph
sheets are carefully filed, and constitute permanent records. With a little
practice they may be read almost as easily as tables, and any attempt to
put them into tabular form is a mere waste of time. For purposes of study
and of publication, it often becomes necessary to bring together all the
results obtained for a particular habitat, both by simple instruments and by
ecographs. The form of record used for this is essentially that already
indicated for simultaneous readings on page <a href='#Page_92'>92</a>, since general features and
constant factors can not well be included in the table. Record sheets of
this type have been printed at a cost of $5 per thousand, and the various
factor records can be obtained at about the same rate. The size of sheet
used is 9½ × 7¾ inches. The record book is the usual notebook cover, which
has been found neither too large nor too small. It is protected from dirt
and rain by a covering of oilcloth which overlaps the edges. Record books
should be carefully labeled, and each one should contain a single year’s
records.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Factor Curves</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>139. Plotting.</b> The paper employed is divided into centimeter squares
which are subdivided into 2–millimeter units. For ordinary curves the
size of sheet is 9½ × 7¾ inches, which makes it possible for curve sheets to
be filed in the record book. Tablets containing 60 of these sheets can be
obtained for 20 cents each from the Central School Supply House, Chicago.
For curves longer than 9 inches special sizes of sheets must be used. On
account of their inconvenience large sheets are avoided whenever possible.
This can usually be accomplished by increasing the numerical value of the
intervals. The inks employed in plotting are the waterproof inks of Chas.
Higgins &#38; Co., Brooklyn, New York. These are made in ten or more
colors, black, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, brown, brick red,
carmine, and scarlet, and cost 25 cents per bottle. In addition to being
waterproof, they make it possible to combine curves in all conceivable
ways without destroying their identity. Furthermore, it is a great advantage
to use the same color invariably for the same kind of curve: thus,
it has been the practice to indicate the 3–foot, surface, 5, 10, and 15–inch
temperature curves by violet, green, yellow, blue, and carmine respectively.
A fine-pointed pen, such as the Spencerian No. 1, is most satisfactory for
inking; drawing pens, such as Gillott’s Crowquill, are too finely pointed for
ordinary use.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>In plotting a curve, it is first necessary to determine the value of the
interval, and the extreme range of the curve or combination. For example,
in the case of temperature, it is most convenient to assign a value of 1°
Centigrade to each centimeter, since the thermometers used read to one-fifth
of a degree, which corresponds exactly to the 2–millimeter units of each
square. The length of the sheet permits a range of 22 degrees Centigrade,
and the actual limits must be determined for the particular results to be
employed. For the same region, it is very desirable that the unit interval
and the range be the same, in order that all curve sheets may admit of direct
comparison. Indeed, it is greatly to be hoped that in the future ecologists
will agree to a uniform system of curve-plotting, cartography, etc., as
the geographers are beginning to do in the construction of maps. The
major intervals are written, or, better, typewritten, at both sides of the
sheet, and the time or space intervals are indicated at the top. Each curve
sheet is properly labeled, and essential data indicated. The readings are
taken from the field record, and their proper positions indicated by a dot.
These are connected first by a pencil line, the curves being made abrupt
rather than flowing; and the line, after having been carefully checked, is
traced in ink.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>140. Kinds of curves.</b> Curves are named both with reference to the
factor concerned and the position or sequence of the readings. The
factors which lend themselves most readily to this method of representation
are the variable ones, water-content, humidity, light, temperature, and
wind, and corresponding curves are distinguished. Altitude and slope may
likewise be shown by means of curves, but the use of cross section or contour
lines serves the same purpose and is more natural. With regard to
time and position, curves are distinguished as level, station, and point
curves. A level curve is one based upon readings made at the same level
through a series of stations or of habitats, e. g., the level curve of surface
temperature. The station curve represents the various levels or points at
which readings are made in a single station. The point curve has for a
basis the hourly or daily variation of a factor at a particular point or level
in a station. All of these may be simple curves, when established upon a
single reading for a series, or mean curves when they are based upon the
mean of a number of readings. Curves which show the extremes of a
factor, i. e., the maximum and minimum, are also extremely valuable,
though a combination of the two for comparison is preferable.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>141. Combinations of curves</b> are invaluable for bringing similar curves
together, and permitting ready comparison of them. For this, and also
because they save space, they are regularly employed to the almost complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>exclusion of single curves. Combinations are made simply by tracing the
curves to be compared upon the same sheet, it being understood that dissimilar
curves, e. g., level and station, can not be combined. Colored inks
are an absolute necessity in combining; the primary principle underlying
their use is that curves that approach closely or cross each other must be
traced in inks that contrast sharply. As elsewhere stated, it has been made
the invariable rule to use the same color for the same level or point. This
applies especially to temperature, but holds also for humidity, light, wind,
and water-content, so that the color always indicates the level. For the
same reason, it is applied to a combination of point curves for one station,
though it is inapplicable to a series of point curves when these lie in the
same level. Light readings above 6 feet and water-content readings below
15 inches necessitate the use of additional colors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Combinations may be made of the curves of a single factor for purposes
of comparison, or they may consist of curves of different factors in order
to aid in interpreting or indicating their relation to each other. Curves of
the same factor may be combined to form various series. The level series
consists of all the level curves for the stations under observation, e. g.,
the six levels for temperature, three levels for wind, etc. Similarly, the
station series is a combination of all the station curves, and a corresponding
arrangement may be made for point curves with reference either to
station or to level. An extremely valuable combination of curves is that of
the holard and chresard for a series of stations. The most important combinations
of the curves of different factors are naturally those based upon
factors intimately related to each other or to the plant. The grouping of
water-content and humidity curves is of great value, especially when the
transpiration curve is added. Light and temperature curves make an interesting
combination, while a humidity, temperature, and wind series is of
much aid in tracing the connection between these factors. Finally, it is
altogether feasible to arrange the curves of water-content, humidity, light,
temperature, and wind upon the same sheet in such fashion as to give a
graphic representation of the whole physical nature of a single habitat or
a series. In all combinations of curves representing different factors, it
must be borne in mind that the position of a curve does not represent a
definite value with reference to the others, since some are based upon per
cents, others upon degrees, etc. The comparison must be based upon the
character of the curves, but even then it is an important aid. An instructive
grouping has been employed where series of readings on the same day,
or on two successive days in forest and in prairie have yielded the usual
level series of curves. The series for the two habitats are arranged on
the same page, one at the right and the other at the left, and permit direct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>comparison of corresponding level or factor curves, both with respect to
position and character.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>142. The amplitude of all the curves</b> described above is determined by
the unit values of the factors concerned, while the length is dependent upon
the number of stations, points, or times. The value assigned the latter
upon the plotting paper is purely arbitrary, but it is most convenient to fix
this at the centimeter square. The unit value for temperature is 1° Centigrade
per square, each subdivision of the latter representing 0.2, and the
range being 22 degrees. For water-content curves, each square represents
a value of 2 per cent, the smaller square being 0.4 per cent, and the range
2–48 per cent. The unit value for humidity is taken as 5 per cent, making
each small square 1 per cent, and giving room on the sheet for the entire
range from 1–100 per cent. Owing to the anemometer used, curves of
wind velocity have been based upon the number of feet per minute. One
hundred feet is taken as the unit value, and the range is from 0–2200 feet.
The unit value for the curve of light intensity is .005. Each small square
is .001, which permits a range from .001 to .01 on one sheet. Consequently,
when it is desired to plot the curve of a series of habitats with a range in
intensity greater than this it is necessary to use a double sheet. This is the
usual device when the range of curves is too great, except where the excess
is slight. In this case the curve is left open at the top, and the value which
the crest attains is indicated. All curves in combination are labeled at the
beginning or left to indicate the level, station, or point, and at the end or
right to show the time, or day, if this is not the basis of the curve or series.</p>

<p class='c007'>The discussion that precedes deals exclusively with curves representing
factors determined in the field. It applies with equal force to results
obtained by instruments in control houses. In these, however, all factors
except those directly experimented with, usually water-content and light,
are practically equalized, and the curves based upon them are used chiefly
to show how nearly equal they have become. The important curves are
those of the water-content series, both holard and chresard, and of the
shade tents. Where several houses are differentiated with respect to temperature
or humidity, curve series of both these factors are necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Factor Means and Sums</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>143.</b> It has been shown elsewhere that the daily mean of temperature can
be closely approximated from the maximum and minimum of both day and
night. Maximum-minimum instruments for the other factors are lacking,
however, and for light, humidity, and wind these values can only be obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>from the ecograph which makes it possible to get the exact mean
from the sum of all the hour readings. When it comes to the seasonal
mean, the ecograph is even more necessary, exception being made for
water-content, in which case a number of readings on various days through
the season will suffice. The value of factor means for diagnosis and for
curves has already been sufficiently commented upon, and the feasibility of
factor sums already indicated.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III. THE PLANT<br> <span class='c014'><span class='sc'>Stimulus and Response</span></span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c018'>GENERAL RELATIONS</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>144. The nature of stimuli.</b> Whatever produces a change in the functions
of a plant is a stimulus. The latter may be a force or a material; it may
be imponderable or ponderable; effect, not character, determines a stimulus.
Consequently, reaction or response decides what constitutes a stimulus.
The presence of the latter can be recognized only through an appreciable
or visible response, since it is impossible to discriminate between an impact
which produces no reaction and one which produces a merely latent one.
From this it is evident that quantity is decisive in determining whether the
impact becomes a stimulus. Plants grow constantly under the influence
of many stimuli, all varying from time to time in amount. Small changes
in these are so frequent that, in many cases at least, the plant no longer
appreciably reacts to them. Such changes, though usually measurable, are
not stimuli. Furthermore, it must be clearly recognized that plants which
are in constant response to stimuli are stimulated anew by an efficient increase
or decrease in the amount of any one of these. As is well known,
however, such increase or decrease is a stimulus only within certain limits,
and the degree of change necessary to produce a response depends upon
the amount of the factor normally present. The entire absence of a force
usually present, moreover, often constitutes a stimulus, as is evident in the
case of light. The nature of the plant itself has a profound bearing upon
the factors that act as stimuli. Many species are extremely labile, and
react strongly to relatively slight stimuli; others are correspondingly stable,
and respond only to stimuli of much greater force. Some light is thrown
upon the nature of this difference by the behavior of ecads. A form which
has grown under comparatively uniform conditions for a long time seems
to respond less readily, and is therefore less labile than one which is subject
to constant fluctuation. In many cases this is not true, however, and
the degree of stability, i. e., of response, can only be connected in a general
way with taxonomic position.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>145. The kinds of stimuli.</b> The factors of a habitat are external to
the plant, and consequently are termed <em>external</em> stimuli. Properly speaking,
all stimuli are external, but since the response is often delayed or can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>not be clearly traced, it may be permissible to speak of <em>internal</em> stimuli, i. e.,
those which appear to originate within the plant. These, however, are
extremely obscure, and it is hardly possible to deal with them until much
more is known of the action of external stimuli. Of the latter, certain
forces, gravity and polarity, act in a way not at all understood, and as
they are essentially alike for all plants and all habitats, they can here be
ignored. Stimuli are imponderable when, like light and heat, they are
measured with reference to intensity, and ponderable, when, as in the case
of water-content, humidity, and salt-content, they can be expressed in mass
or weight. It is undesirable to insist upon this distinction, however, since
the real character of a stimulus is determined by its effect, and the latter
is not necessarily dependent upon whether the stimulus is one of force or one
of material. There is, however, a fundamental difference between factors
with respect to their relation to the plant. Direct factors alone are stimuli,
since indirect factors must always act through them. For example, the
wind, its mechanical influence excepted, can affect the plant only in so far
as it is converted into the stimulus of increased or decreased humidity. Consequently,
the normal stimuli of the plants of a formation are: (1) water-content,
(2) solutes, (3) humidity, (4) light, (5) temperature, (6) wind.
Soil, pressure, physiography, and biotic factors influence plants only
through these, and are not stimuli, though exceptions must be made of
biotic factors in the case of sensitive, insectivorous, and gall-producing
plants.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>146. The nature of response.</b> Since plants have no special organs for
the perception of stimuli, nor sensory tracts for their transmission, an external
stimulus acting upon a plant organ is ordinarily converted into a response
at once. The latter as a rule becomes evident immediately; in some
cases it is latent or imperceptible, or some time elapses before the chain of responses
finds visible expression. A marked decrease in humidity calls forth an
immediate increase of transpiration, but the ultimate response is seen in the
closing of the stomata. A response to decreased light intensity, on the
other hand, is much less rapid and obvious. This difference is largely due
to the fact that the functional response is more marked, or at least more
perceptible in one case than in the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Response is the reaction of the plant to a stimulus; it begins with the
impact of an efficient factor, and ends only with the consequent final readjustment.
The immediate reaction is always functional. The nature and
intensity of the stimulus determine whether this functional response is
followed by a corresponding change in structure. The consideration of this
theme consequently gains in clearness if a functional and a structural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>response be distinguished. The chief value of this distinction lies in the
fact that many reactions are functional alone; it serves also to emphasize
the absolute interdependence of structure and function, and the imperative
need of considering both in connection with the common stimulus. For
these reasons, the logical treatment is to connect each stimulus with its
proper functional change, and, through this, with the corresponding modification
of structure. For the sake of convenience, the term <em>adjustment</em>
is used to denote response in function, and <em>adaptation</em>, to indicate the response
in structure.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>147. Adjustment and adaptation.</b> The adjustment of a plant to the
stimuli of its habitat is a constant process. It is the daily task, seen in
nutrition and growth. So long as these take place under stimulation by
factors which fall within the normal variation of the habitat, the problems
belong to what has long been called physiology. When the stimuli become
unusual in degree or in kind, by a change of habitat or a modification in it,
adjustment is of much greater moment and is recorded in the plant’s structure.
These structural records are the foundation of proper ecological
study. Since they are the direct result of adjustment, however, this affords
further evidence that a division of the field into ecology and physiology
is illogical and superficial. Slight or periodical adjustment may concern
function alone; it may be expressed in the movement of parts or organs,
such as the closing of stomata or changes in the position of leaves, in
growth, or in modifications of structure. This expression is fundamentally
affected by the nature of the factor and is in direct relation to the intensity
of the latter. Adaptation comprises all structural changes resulting from
adjustment. It includes both growth and modification. The latter is
merely growth in response to unusual stimuli, but this fact is the real
clue to all evolution. Growth is periodic, and in a sense quantitative; it
results from the normal continuous adjustment of the plant to the stimuli
of its proper habitat. In contrast, modification is relatively permanent and
qualitative; it is the response to stimuli unusual in kind or intensity. A
definite knowledge of the processes of growth is indispensable to an understanding
of modification. In the fundamental task of connecting plant and
habitat, it is the modification of the plant, and not its growth, which records
the significant responses to stimuli. For this reason the discussion of
adaptation in the pages that follow is practically confined to modification
of structure. This is particularly desirable, since growth has long been the
theme of physiological study, while modification has too often been considered
from the structural standpoint alone. The comparatively few
studies that have taken function into account have been largely empirical;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>in them neither stimulus nor adaptation has received anything approaching
adequate treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>148. The measurement of response.</b> The amount of response to a
stimulus is proportional to the intensity of the factor concerned. This does
not mean that the same stimulus produces the same response in two distinct
species, or necessarily in two plants of one species. In these cases the rule
holds only when the plants or species are equally plastic. For each individual,
however, this quantitative correspondence of stimulus and response
is fundamental. It is uncertain whether an exact or constant ratio can be
established between factor and function; the answer to this must await the
general use of quantitative methods. There can be no doubt, however,
that within certain limits the adjustment is proportional to the amount of
stimulus, whereas reaction is well known to be abnormal or inhibited beyond
certain extremes. It is quite erroneous to think that reaction is independent
of quantity of stimulus, or to liken the stimulating factor to “the smallest
spark (which) by igniting a mass of powder, produces an enormous
mechanical effect.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Such a statement is only apparently true of the action
of mechanical stimuli upon the few plants that may properly be said to
possess irritability, such as sensitive plants and certain insectivorous ones.
Of the normal relation of response to direct factors, water, light, etc., it is
entirely untrue. Axiomatically, there is ordinarily an essential correspondence,
also, between the amount of adjustment and of adaptation. This
correspondence is profoundly affected, however, by the structural stability
of the plant.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the preceding it follows that the measurement of response and the
relating it to definite amounts of direct factors as stimuli are two of the
most fundamental tasks of ecology. The exact determination of physical
factors has no value apart from its use for this purpose. It is perfectly
clear that precise methods of measuring stimuli call for similar methods in
determining the amount of adjustment and of adaptation. The problem is
a difficult one, and it is possible at present only to indicate the direction
which its development should take, and to describe a few methods which
will at least serve as a beginning. To cover the ground adequately it is
necessary to measure response by adjustment and by adaptation separately,
and in the latter to find a measure for the individual and one for the
species. The one is furnished by the methods of morphology and the other
by biometry.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>A primary requisite for any method for measuring adjustment is that it
be applicable to field conditions. Many instruments for measuring transpiration,
for example, are valueless, not because they are inaccurate, but
because the plant studied is under abnormal conditions. To avoid the latter
is absolutely necessary, a fact which makes it peculiarly difficult to devise a
satisfactory field method. After the latter has been found and applied, it
becomes possible to check other methods by it, and to give them real value.
The final test of a field method is three-fold: (1) the plant must be studied
while functioning normally in its own habitat; (2) the method must give
accurate results; and (3) it must permit of extensive and fairly convenient
application in the field. Until methods of this character, some of which
are described later, have been employed for some time, it is impossible to
connect definite intensities of factor stimuli with measured amounts of
adjustment. Ultimately, it seems certain that researches will regularly take
this form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adaptation is primarily indicated by changes in the arrangement and
character of the cells of the plant. Since these determine the form of each
organ, morphology also furnishes important evidence in regard to the
course of adaptation, but form can be connected certainly with adjustment
only through the study of cellular adaptation. In tracing the modifications
of cell and of tissue, the usual methods of histology, viz., sectioning and
drawing, suffice for the individual. It is merely necessary to select plants
and organs which are as nearly typical as can be determined. The question
of quantity becomes paramount, however, since it often gives the clue
to qualitative changes, and hence it is imperative that complete and accurate
measurements of cells, tissues, and organs be made. These measurements,
when extended to a sufficiently large number of plants, serve to indicate
the direction of adaptation in the species. They constitute the materials for
determining biometrically the mean of adaptation for the species and the
probable evolution of the latter. In its present development, biometry contains
too much mathematics, and too little biology. This has perhaps been
unavoidable, but it is to be hoped that the future will bring about a wise
sifting of methods, which will make biometry the ready and invaluable
servant of all serious students of experimental evolution. This condition
does not obtain at present, and in consequence it seems unwise to consider
the subject of biometry in this treatise.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>149. Plasticity and fixity.</b> As the product of accumulated responses,
each species is characterized by a certain ability or inability to react to
stimuli. Many facts seem to indicate that the degree of stability is connected
with the length of time during which the species is acted upon by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>the same stimuli. It seems probable that plants which have reacted to sunlight
for hundreds of years will respond less readily to shade than those
which have grown in the sun for a much shorter period. This hypothesis
is not susceptible of proof in nature because it is ordinarily impossible to
distinguish species upon the basis of the time during which they have
occupied one habitat. Evidence and ultimate proof, perhaps, can be obtained
only by field and control experiments, in which the time of occupation of
any habitat is definitely known. Even in this case, however, it is clear
that antecedent habitats will have left effects which can neither be traced nor
ignored. Additional support is given this view by the fact that extreme
types, both ecological and taxonomic, are the most stable. Intense xerophytes
and hydrophytes are much more fixed than mesophytes, though the
intensity of the stimulus has doubtless as great an influence as its duration.
Composites, labiates, grasses, orchids, etc., are less plastic than ranals,
rosals, etc., but there are many exceptions to the apparent rule that fixity
increases with taxonomic complexity. At present it seems quite impossible
to suggest an explanation of the rule. Recent experiments indicate that
there may be ancestral fixity of function, as well as of structure. It has
been found, for example, that the flowers of certain species always react
normally to the stimuli which produce opening and closing, while others
make extremely erratic response. If further work confirms this result and
extends it to other functions, the necessity of arriving at a better understanding
of fixity will be greatly emphasized.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to make progress in the study of adaptation without
recognizing the fundamental importance of ancestral fixity as a factor.
E. S. Clements<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a> has shown that a number of species undergo pronounced
changes in habitat without showing appreciable modification. Consequently,
it is incorrect to assume that each habitat puts a structural impress upon
every plant that enters it. For this reason, the writer feels that the current
explanation of xerophytic bog plants, etc., is probably wrong, and that the
discrepancy between the nature of the habitat and the structure of the plant
is to be explained by the persistence of a fixed ancestral type. The anomaly
is scarcely greater than in cases that have proved capable of being
explained.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>150. The law of extremes.</b> When a stimulus approaches either the
maximum or minimum of the factor for the species concerned, response
becomes abnormal. The resulting modifications approach each other and
in some respects at least become similar. Such effects are found chiefly in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>growth, but they occur to some degree in structure also. It is imperative
that they be recognized in nature as well as in field and control experiment,
since they directly affect the ratio between response and stimulus. The
data which bear upon the similarity of response to extremes of different
factors are too meager to permit the formulation of a rule. It is permissible,
however, to suggest the general principle that extreme stimuli produce
similar growth responses, and to emphasize the need of testing its application
to adaptation proper.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>151. The method of working hypotheses.</b> In the study of stimulus
and response, where the unimpeachable facts are relatively few, and their
present correlation slight, the working hypothesis is an indispensable aid.
“The true course of inductive procedure&#160;... consists in <em>anticipating
nature</em>, in the sense of forming hypotheses as to the laws which are probably
in operation, and then observing whether the combinations of
phenomena are such as would follow from the laws supposed. The investigator
begins with facts and ends with them. He uses such facts as are in
the first place known to him in suggesting probable hypotheses; deducing
other facts which would happen if a particular hypothesis is true, he
proceeds to test the truth of his notion by fresh observations or experiments.
If any result prove different from what he expects, it leads him
either to abandon or to modify his hypothesis; but every new fact may give
some new suggestion as to the laws in action. Even if the result in any
case agrees with his anticipations, he does not regard it as finally confirmatory
of his theory, but proceeds to test the truth of the theory by new deductions
and new trials.”<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a> In the treatment of adjustment and adaptation
which follows, the method of multiple working hypotheses is uniformly employed.
No apology is felt to be necessary for this, since the whole endeavor
is to indicate the proper points of attack, and not to distinguish between
that which is conjectural and that which is known. If an hypothesis occasionally
seem to be stated too strongly, it is merely that it appears, after a
survey of the problem from all sides, to explain the facts most satisfactorily.
The final proof of any hypothesis, however, rests not only upon its ability
to explain all the facts, but also upon the inability of other hypotheses to
meet the same test. The discovery and examination of all possible hypotheses,
and the elimination of those that prove inadequate are the essential
steps in the method of working hypotheses.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>152. Water as a stimulus.</b> Plants are continually subjected to the
action of the water of the soil and of the air; exception must naturally
be made of submerged plants. The stimulus of soil water acts upon the
absorbing organ, the root, while that of humidity affects the part most
exposed to the air, viz., the assimilative organ, which is normally the leaf.
But since both are simultaneous water stimuli, a clearer conception is gained
of this operation if they are viewed as two phases of the same stimulus.
This point of view receives further warrant from the essential and intimate
relation of humidity and water-content as determined by the plant. They
are in fact largely compensatory, as is shown at some length later. In
determining the intensity of the two, a significant difference between them
must be recognized. The total humidity of the air at any one time constitutes
a stimulus to the leaf which it touches. This is not true of the total
soil water. Part of the latter is not available under any circumstances,
and can not affect the plant, at least directly. The chresard alone can act
as a stimulus, but even this is potential in the great majority of cases, since
the actual stimulus is not the water available but the water absorbed. The
latter, moreover, contains many nutrient salts which are in themselves
stimuli, but as they normally have little bearing upon the action of water
as a stimulus they are to be considered only when present in excessive
amounts.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>153. The influence of other factors upon water.</b> The amount of humidity
is modified directly by temperature, wind, precipitation, and pressure,
and, through these, it is affected by altitude, slope, exposure, and cover.
Naturally, also, the evaporation of soil water has a marked influence. In
determining water-content, atmospheric factors, with the exception of precipitation,
are usually subordinate to edaphic ones. Soil texture, slope, and
precipitation act directly in determining soil water, while temperature, wind,
and pressure can operate only through humidity. This is likewise true of
altitude, exposure, and cover, though the latter has in addition a profound
effect upon run-off. Biotic factors can affect humidity or water-content
only through the medium of another factor. Light in itself has no action
upon either, but through its conversion into heat within the chloroplast, it has
a profound effect upon transpiration. The following table indicates the
general relation between water and the other physical factors of the habitat.

<p class='c007'><b>154. Response.</b> The normal functional responses to water stimuli are
absorption, diffusion, transport, and transpiration. Of these, absorption and
transpiration alone are the immediate response to soil water and humidity,
respectively. Consequently they are the critical points of attack in studying
the fundamental relation of the plant to the water of its habitat. In
determining the pathway of the response, it is necessary to trace the steps
in diffusion and transport, but, as these are essentially alike for all vascular
plants, this task lies outside the scope of the work in hand. As previously
suggested, the relation between absorption and transpiration is strictly compensatory,
though, for obvious reasons, the amount of water transpired is
usually somewhat less than the amount absorbed. Absorption falls below
transpiration when extreme conditions cause temporary or permanent wilting;
the two activities are essentially equal after a growing plant reaches
maturity. In all cases, however, the rule is that an increase or decrease in
water loss produces a corresponding change in the amount of water
absorbed, and, conversely, variation in absorption produces a consequent
change in transpiration. This is strictly true only when the stimuli are
normal. For example, a decrease in humidity causes increased water loss,
which, through diffusion and transport, is compensated by increased activity
of the root surface. Frequently the water supply is insufficient to compensate
for a greater stimulus, and the proper balance can be attained only by
the closing of the stomata. In the case of excessive stimuli, neither compensation
suffices, and the plant dies. Many mesophytes and all xerophytes
have probably resulted from stimuli which regularly approached the limit
of compensation for each, and often overstepped, but never permanently
exceeded it. For hydrophytes, the danger arises from excessive water
supply, not water loss. There is a limit to the compensation afforded by
transpiration, which is naturally dependent upon the amount of plant surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>exposed to the air. No compensation occurs in the case of submerged
plants; floating hydrophytes possess a single transpiring leaf surface, while
the leaves of amphibious plants behave as do those of mesophytes. The
whole question of response to water stimuli thus turns upon the compensation
for water loss afforded by water supply where the latter is moderate
or precarious, and upon the compensation for water supply furnished by
water loss where the supply is excessive, submerged plants excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>155. The measurement of absorption.</b> As responses to measured
stimuli of water-content and humidity, it is imperative that the amount of
absorption and of transpiration be determined quantitatively. It is also
extremely desirable that this be done in the normal habitat of the plant.
A careful examination of the problems to be met quickly discloses the great
difficulty of obtaining a direct and accurate measure of absorption under
normal conditions, especially in the field. For this purpose, the ordinary
potometric experiments by means of cut stems are valueless. The use of
the entire plant in a potometer yields much more trustworthy results, though
the fact that the root is under abnormal conditions can not be overlooked,
especially in the case of mesophytes and xerophytes. While potometric
conditions are less abnormal for amphibious plants, the error is not wholly
eliminated, since the roots normally grow in the soil. The potometer can
be made of value for quantitative work only by checking the results it gives
by means of an instrument or a method in which the plant functions normally.
In consequence, the potometer can not at present be used to measure
absorption directly, though, as is further indicated in the discussion of
transpiration, it is a valuable supplementary instrument, after the check
mentioned has been applied to its use with a particular species.</p>

<p class='c007'>An estimate of the amount of absorption may be obtained either in the
field or in the control house by taking samples from the protected soil at
different times. Since it is impossible to determine the weight of the area
in which the roots lie, and since the soil water is often unequally distributed,
this method can not yield exact results. An accurate method of measuring
absorption under essentially normal conditions has been devised and tested
in the control house. The essential feature of the process is the placing  a
plant in a soil containing a known quantity of water, and removing it after
it has absorbed water from the soil for a certain period. In carrying out
the experiment, a soil consisting of two parts of sod and one of sand was used,
since the aeration is more perfect and the particles are more easily removed
from the roots. The soil was completely dried out in a water bath and then
placed in a five-inch battery jar. The latter, together with the rubber cloth
used later to prevent evaporation, was weighed to the decigram. A
weighed quantity of water was added, and the whole again weighed as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>check. Two plants of <em>Helianthus annuus</em> were taken from the pots in which
they had grown, and the soil was carefully washed from the roots. Each
plant was weighed with its roots in a dish of water to prevent wilting,
and then carefully potted, one in each battery jar. A thistle tube was placed
in the soil of each jar to facilitate aeration, as well as the addition of
weighed amounts of water, when necessary, and the rubber cloth attached
in the usual manner to prevent evaporation. The entire outfit was weighed
again, and the weighing repeated at 8:00 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> and 5:00 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> for five days,
in order to determine the amount of transpiration and its relation to the
water absorbed. The plants were kept in diffuse light to prevent excessive
water loss while the roots were becoming established. At the close of the
experiment, the jar and its contents were weighed finally. The plants were
removed and weighed, the soil particles being shaken from the roots into
the jar, which was also weighed. The results obtained were as follows:</p>

<p class='c029'>The amount of water absorbed may be obtained directly by subtracting the
final weight of the jar and moist soil from their first weight, but a desirable
check is obtained by taking the dry weight of jar and soil from the first,
and the final weight of these, and subtracting the one from the other as
indicated in the table. A second check is afforded by daily weighings,
from which the amount of water transpired is determined. Since the two
sunflower plants made practically no growth during the period of experiment,
the exact correspondence between water absorbed and water lost is
not startling, though it can not be expected that the results will always
coincide.</p>

<p class='c007'>This method has certain slight sources of error, all of which, it is thought,
have been corrected in a new and more complete series of experiments
now being carried on. The aeration of the soil is not entirely normal, as is
also true of the capillary movements of the water, on account of the nonporous
glass jar and the rubber cloth. Since the latter are necessary conditions
of all accurate methods for measuring absorption and transpiration,
the resulting error must be ignored. It can be reduced, however, by forcing
air through the thistle tube from time to time. Sturdy plants, such as the
sunflower, are the most satisfactory, since they recover more quickly from
the shock of transplanting. Almost any plant can be used, however, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>repotted in a loose sandy soil often enough. This permits the root system
to develop normally, and also makes it possible to wash the soil away without
injury to the root. The method is so recent that there has been
no opportunity to test it in the field. It would seem that it can be applied
without essential change to plants in their normal habitats. Very large
herbs or plants with extensive root systems could not be used to advantage,
and to be practicable the experiments would need to be carried on near the
base station. The great value of the method, however, lies in its use as a
check in determining the accuracy of other methods, and in practice it will
often be found convenient and time-saving to use the latter, after they have
once been carefully checked for different groups of species. This matter is
further considered under measures of transpiration.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>156. The quantitative relation of absorption and transpiration.</b> Burgerstein<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
has summarized the results of various investigators in the statement
“that between the quantitative absorption of water on the one hand
and emission on the other there exists no constant parallelism or proportion,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>and he has cited the work of Kröber, and of Eberdt in proof. This statement
holds, however, only for short periods of a few hours, or more rarely, a
day, and even here its truth still remains to be conclusively demonstrated.
The discrepancy between absorption and transpiration for a short period is
often greater than for a longer time, but it is evident that a transient change
in behavior or a small error in the method would inevitably produce this
result. Eberdt found the discrepancy for a few hours to be 1–2 ccm. in an
entire plant of <em>Helianthus annuus</em>, while for a whole day the water absorbed
was 33.57 ccm. and the water lost 33.98 ccm. Kröber’s experiments with
cut branches of <em>Asclepias incarnata</em> showed a maximum difference for 12
hours of 2.5 ccm., but the discrepancy for the first 24 hours was 1 ccm.
and for the second 1.9 ccm. In both cases, the potometer was employed.
Consequently, as will be shown later, Eberdt’s results are not entirely trustworthy,
while those of Kröber, made with cut stems, are altogether unreliable.
Hence, it is clear that the discrepancy is slight for a period of several
days or weeks, and that it may be ignored without serious error, except in
a few plants that retain considerable water as cell-sap, in consequence of
extremely rapid growth. Accordingly, the amount of transpiration, which
may be readily and accurately determined, can be employed as a measure
of absorption that is sufficiently accurate for nearly all purposes. The
truth of this statement may be easily confirmed. It is evident that the
amount of water absorbed equals the amount transpired plus that retained
by the plant as cell-sap, or used in the manufacture of organic compounds.
In plants not actively growing, the amount lost equals that absorbed, as
already shown in the experiment with <em>Helianthus</em>. According to Gain<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a>,
Dehérain has found that a plant rooted in ordinary soil transpired 680 kg.
of water for each kilogram of dry substance elaborated. In <em>Helianthus
annuus</em>, the dry matter is 10 per cent of the weight of the green plant. A
well-grown plant weighing 1,000 grams, therefore, consists of 100 grams
of dry matter and 900 of water. The length of the growing period for
such a plant is approximately 100 days, during which it transpires 68 kilograms
of water. Assuming the rate of transpiration and of growth to be
constant, the plant transpires 680 grams daily, adds 9 grams to its cell-sap,
and 1 gram to its dry weight. The amount of water in a gram of cellulose
and its isomers is about ⅗. Consequently, the total water absorbed daily
by the plant is 689.6 grams. The 680 grams transpired are 98.6 per cent
of the amount absorbed; in other words, only 1.4 per cent of the water
absorbed is retained by the plant. From this it is evident that the simplest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>and most convenient measure of absorption under normal conditions can be
obtained through transpiration, since the discrepancy between absorption and
transpiration is scarcely larger than the error of any method applicable
to the field. Conversely, the measure of absorption obtained by the process
described in the preceding section serves also as a measure of transpiration.
The determination of the latter in the field is so much simpler, however,
that it is rarely desirable to apply the absorption method.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>157. Measurement of transpiration.</b> The water loss of a plant may be
determined absolutely or relatively. Absolute or quantitative determinations
are by (1) weighing, (2) collecting, or (3) measuring the water absorbed;
relative values are indicated by hygroscopic substances. A number of
methods have been employed more or less generally for measuring transpiration.
The great majority of these can be used to advantage only in the
laboratory, and practically all fail to meet the fundamental requirement for
successful field work, namely, that the plant be studied under normal conditions
in its own habitat. The following is a summary of the various
methods, the details of which may be found in Burgerstein.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Weighing.</em> This is the most satisfactory of all methods for determining
water loss. It is more accurate than any other, and is unique in that
it does not place the plant under abnormal conditions. On the score of
convenience, moreover, it excels every other method capable of yielding
quantitative results. Various modifications of weighing are employed, but
none of these have all the advantages of a direct, simple weighing of the
plant in its own soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Collecting the water transpired.</em> This may be done by collecting
and weighing the water vapor exhaled by a plant placed within a bell jar,
or by weighing a deliquescent salt, such as calcium chloride, which is used
to absorb the water of transpiration. The decisive disadvantage of these
methods is that transpiration is carried on in an atmosphere far more humid
than normal. If an excessive amount of salt is used, the air is abnormally
dry. In both cases, the water loss decreases until it reaches a point much
below the usual amount. Finally, all methods of this kind are open to considerable
error, and are inconvenient, especially in field work. They are
of relatively slight value in comparison with weighing.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Potometers.</em> It has already been shown that the amount of water
absorbed is a close measure of the amount transpired. In consequence, the
potometer can be used to determine the amount of transpiration provided
the absorption is not abnormal. It is rarely and only with much difficulty
that this condition can be met. The use of cut stems and branches does not
meet it, and even in the case of plants with roots, the results must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>compared with those obtained from absorption experiments made with
plants rooted in soil before they can be relied upon. This necessity practically
puts the potometer out of commission for accurate work, unless future
study may show a somewhat constant ratio between the absorption of a plant
in its own soil and that of a plant placed in a potometer.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Measuring absolute humidity.</em> The cog psychrometer makes it
possible to determine the increased relative humidity produced within a
glass cylinder or special tin chamber by a transpiring plant. From this
result the absolute humidity is readily obtained, and by means of the latter
the actual amount of water given off. The evident drawback to this
method is that the increasing humidity within the chamber gives results
entirely abnormal for the plant concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>Self-registering instruments.</em> There are various methods for registering
the amount of transpiration, based upon weighing, or upon the potometer.
The Richard recording evaporimeter has all the advantages of
weighing, inasmuch as the water loss is measured in this way, and in addition
the amount is recorded upon a revolving drum, obviating the necessity
of repeated attention in case it is desirable to know the exact course of
transpiration. On the other hand, methods which depend upon the potometer,
while graphic, are not sufficiently accurate to be of value.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. <em>The use of hygroscopic materials.</em> Hygroscopic substances change
their form or color in response to moisture. As they indicate comparative
water loss alone, they are of value chiefly in the study of the stomatic
surfaces of leaves. F. Darwin<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c017'><sup>[13]</sup></a> has used strips of horn, awns of <em>Stipa</em>, and
epidermis of <em>Yucca</em> to construct small hygroscopes for this purpose. In
these instruments the error is large, but as no endeavor is made to obtain
exact results, it is negligible. Filter paper impregnated with a 3–5 per
cent aqueous solution of cobalt chloride is deep blue when dry. If a strip
of cobalt paper is placed upon a leaf and covered with a glass slip it turns
bright rose color, the rapidity of the change affording a clue to the amount
of transpiration.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>158. Field methods.</b> The conditions which a satisfactory field method
of measuring transpiration must fulfill have already been discussed; they
are accuracy, simplicity, and normality. These conditions are met only by
weighing the plant in its own soil and habitat. This has been accomplished
by means of the sheet-iron soil box, already described under the determination
of the chresard. The method is merely the familiar one of pot and
balance, slightly modified for field use. The soil block, which contains the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>plant to be studied, is cut out, and the metal plates put in position as indicated
in section 53. Indeed, it is a great saving of time and effort to determine
transpiration and chresard in the same experiment; this is particularly
desirable in view of the close connection between them. In this event,
the soil block must be small enough not to exceed the load of a field balance.
After the block is cut and encased, all the plants are removed, except the
one to be studied. If several individuals of the same species are present,
it is an advantage to leave all of them, since the error arising from individual
variations of water loss may, in this way, be almost completely eliminated.
A sheet of rubber or rubber cloth is carefully tied over the box to prevent
evaporation from the soil. A broad band is passed under the box to aid in
lifting it upon the scales. The latter must be of the platform type, and
should have a capacity as great as consistent with the need for moving
it about in the field. Weighings are made in the usual way, care being
taken to free the surface of the box from soil. The aeration of the soil block
is kept normal by removing the rubber for a few minutes from time to
time, or by forcing air through a thistle tube. Water is also added through
the latter, when it is desired to continue the experiment for a considerable
period. After the study of transpiration is concluded, the rubber cloth is
removed, soil samples taken, and the soil allowed to dry out until the plant
becomes thoroughly wilted. If the box is weighed again, the difference
represents the amount of available water. The per cent of chresard is also
obtained in the usual way by taking samples for ascertaining the echard,
and subtracting this from the holard. Field determinations of water loss
yield the most valuable results when different habitat forms, or ecads, of
the same species are used. There is little profit in comparing the transpiration
of a typical sun plant, such as <em>Touterea multiflora</em>, with that of a shade
plant, such as <em>Washingtonia obtusa</em>. But the simultaneous study of plants
like <em>Chamaenerium angustifolium</em>, <em>Gentiana acuta</em>, <em>Scutellaria brittonii</em>
etc., which grow in several different habitats, furnishes direct and fundamental
evidence of the course of adjustment and adaptation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hesselmann<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a>, in his study of open woodlands in Sweden, has employed
a method essentially similar to the preceding. Young plants of various
species were transferred to pots in the field, where they were allowed to
grow for several months before a series of weighings was made to determine
the amount of transpiration. Since weighing is the measure used in each,
both methods are equally accurate. The one has a certain advantage in that
the pots are, perhaps, more easily handled, while the other has the advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of maintaining the normal relation of soil and roots, a condition more or less
impossible in a pot. In both instances the weighing should be done in the
habitat, which was not the case in Hesselmann’s researches.</p>

<p class='c007'>The slight value of the potometer, which has had a vogue far beyond its
merits, is indicated by the following table. These results were obtained
from three plants of <em>Helianthus annuus</em>; III was left undisturbed in the
pot where it had been growing, IV was placed in a potometer, after the
root had been cut off, and V was an entire plant placed in a potometer.
The amount of transpiration is indicated in grams per square decimeter of
leaf surface. The plants were kept in diffuse light, except for a period of
two hours (8:00 to 10:00 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>) on the last day, when they were in full
sunshine at a temperature of 75° F. Plant IV wilted so promptly in the
sunshine that it was found necessary to conclude the experiment in
diffuse light.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cut plant, IV, lost more water the first day than either of the others,
but the water loss soon decreased, and at the end of the period was almost
nil. The total transpiration for III and V is much the same, but the range
of variation for periods of 12 hours is from +2 to –1 gram. This experiment
is taken as a fair warrant that the use of cut stems in potometers
can not give accurate results. It is inconclusive, however, as to the merits of
potometric values obtained by means of the entire plant, and further studies
are now being made with reference to this point.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>159. Expression of results.</b> From the previous discussion of the relation
between them, it follows that an expression of the amount of transpiration
likewise constitutes an expression of absorption. It is very desirable also
that the latter be based upon root surface and chresard, but the difficulty of
determining the former accurately and readily is at present too great to
make such a basis practicable. In expressing transpiration in exact terms,
the fact that plants of the same species or form are somewhat individual in
their behavior must be constantly reckoned with. In consequence, experiments
should be made upon two or three individuals whenever possible, in
order to avoid the error arising from this source.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Water loss may be expressed either in terms of transpiring surface or
of dry weight. Since there is no constant relation between surface and
weight, the terms are not interchangeable or comparable, and in practice it
is necessary to use one to the exclusion of the other. Obviously, surface
furnishes by far the best basis, on account of its intimate connection with
stomata and air-spaces, a conclusion which Burgerstein (<em>l. c.</em>, p. <a href='#Page_6'>6</a>) has
shown by experiment to be true. For the best results, the whole transpiring
surface should be determined. This is especially necessary in making comparisons
of different species. In those studies which are of the greatest
value, viz., ecads of the same species, it is scarcely desirable to measure stem
and petiole surfaces, unless these organs show unusual modification. The
actual transpiring surface is constituted by the walls of the cells bordering
the intercellular spaces, but, since it is impossible to determine the aggregate
area of these, or the humidity of the air-spaces themselves, the leaf surface
must be taken as a basis. Since the transpiration through the stomata is
much greater than that through the epidermal walls, the number of stomata
must be taken into account. Since they are usually less abundant on the
upper surface, their number should be determined for both sides of the
leaf. The errors arising from more or less irregular distribution are eliminated
by making counts near the tip, base, and middle of two or three mature
leaves. The most convenient unit of leaf surface is the square decimeter.
The simplest way to determine the total leaf area of a plant is to
outline the leaves upon a homogeneous paper, or to print them upon a
photographic paper. The outlines are then cut out and weighed, and the
leaf area obtained in square decimeters by dividing the total weight by the
weight of a square decimeter of the paper used. The area may also be
readily determined by means of a planimeter.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>160. Coefficient of transpiration.</b> At present it does not seem feasible
to express the transpiration of a plant in the form of a definite coefficient,
but it is probable that the application of exact methods to each part of the
problem will finally bring about this result. Meanwhile the following
formula is suggested as a step toward this goal: <em>t</em> = <em>g</em>(<em>u/l</em>)<em>LHT</em>, in which
<em>t</em>, the transpiration relation of a plant, is expressed by the number of grams
of water lost per hour, on a day of sunshine, by one square decimeter of
leaf, considered with reference to the stomata of the two surfaces, and the
amount of the controlling physical factors, light, humidity, and temperature,
at the time of determination. For <em>Helianthus annuus</em>, this formula would
appear as follows: <em>t</em>&#8201;=&#8201;2(²⁰⁰⁄₂₅₀)&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;50&#8201;:&#8201;75°. To avoid the large figures arising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>from the extent of surface considered, the number of stomata per
square decimeter is divided by 10,000. This amounts to the number per
square millimeter, and time may consequently be saved by using this figure
directly. While this formula obviously leaves much to be desired, it has
the great advantage of making it possible to compare ecads of one species,
or species of the same habitat or of different habitats, upon an exact basis
of factor, function, and structure.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>ADAPTATION</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>161. Modifications due to water stimuli.</b> In adaptation, the great
desideratum is to connect each modification quantitatively with the corresponding
adjustment. This is even more difficult than to ascertain the
quantitative relation between stimulus and functional response, a task still
beset with serious obstacles. At the present time, little more can be done
than to indicate the relation of marked adaptations of organs and tissues to
the direct factors operating upon them, and to attempt to point out among
the functions possibly concerned the one which seems to be the most probable
connection between the probable stimulus and the structure under
investigation. In the pages that follow, no more than this is attempted.
The general changes of organs and tissues produced by water are first discussed,
and after this is given a summary of the structural features of the
plant types based upon water-content.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>162. Modifications due to a small water supply.</b> A water supply which
may become deficient at any time is compensated either by changes which
decrease transpiration, or by those that increase the amount of water
absorbed or stored. These operate upon the form and size of the organs
concerned, as well as upon their structure. Modifications of the form of
leaf and stem are alike in that they lessen transpiration by a reduction of
the amount of surface exposed to the air. Structural adaptations, on the
other hand, bring about the protection of epidermal cells and stomata, and
often internal cells also, from the factors which cause transpiration, or
they anticipate periods of excessive transpiration by the storage of water
in specialized cells or tissues. In certain extreme types the epidermis is
itself modified for the absorption of water vapor from the air.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>163. The decrease of water loss.</b> The following is a summary of the
contrivances for reducing transpiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Position of the leaf.</em> Since the energy of a ray of sunlight is greatest
at the sun’s highest altitudes, those leaves transpire least which are in such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>position during midday that the rays strike them as obliquely as possible. A
leaf at right angles to the noonday sun receives ten times as much light
and heat upon a square decimeter of surface as does one placed at an angle
of 10 degrees. This device for reducing the intensity of insolation is best
developed in the erect or hanging leaves of many tropical trees. In temperate
zones, it is found in such plants as <em>Silphium laciniatum</em> and <em>Lactuca
scariola</em>, and in species with equitant leaves. In such plants as <em>Helianthus
annuus</em>, the effect is just the opposite, since the turning of the crown keeps
the leaves for a long time at a high angle to the incident rays. In the case
of mats, it is the aggregation of plants which brings about the mutual protection
of the leaves from insolation and wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Rolling of the leaf.</em> Many grasses and ericaceous plants possess leaves
capable of rolling or folding themselves together when drouth threatens.
In other cases, the leaves are permanently rolled or folded. The advantage
of this device arises not only from the reduction of surface, but also from
the fact that the stomata come to lie in a chamber more or less completely
closed. In the case of those mosses whose leaves roll or twist, a reduction
of surface alone is effected.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Reduction of leaf.</em> The transpiring surface of a plant is reduced by
decreasing the number of leaves, by reducing the size of each leaf, or by a
change in its form. In so far as the stem is a leaf, a decrease in size or a
change in shape brings about the same result. The final outcome of reduction
in size or number is the complete loss of leaves, and more rarely, of
the stem. Such marked decrease of leaf area is found only in intense
xerophytes, though it occurs in all deciduous trees as a temporary adaptation.
Changes in leaf form are nearly always accompanied by a decrease
in size. Of the forms which result, the scale, the linear or cylindrical leaf,
and the succulent leaf are the most common. Leaves which show a
tendency to divide often increase the number of lobes or make them smaller.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Epidermal modifications.</em> Excretions of wax and lime by the epidermis
have a pronounced effect by increasing the impermeability of the cuticle,
and, hence, decreasing epidermal transpiration. It seems improbable that
a coating of wax on the lower surface of a diphotic leaf can have this
purpose. The thickening of the outer wall of epidermal cells to form a
cuticle is the most perfect of all contrivances for decreasing permeability
and reducing transpiration. In many desert plants, the greatly thickened
cuticle effectually prevents epidermal transpiration. In these also the
cuticle is regularly developed in such a way as to protect the guard cells,
and even to close the opening partially. An epidermis consisting of two or
more layers of cells is an effective, though less frequent device against water
loss. When combined with a cuticle, as is usually the case, the impermeability
is almost complete. Hairs decrease transpiration by screening the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>epidermis so that the amount of light and heat is diminished, and the access
and movement of dry air impeded. While hairs assume the most various
forms, all hairy coverings serve the same purpose, even when, as in the
case of <em>Mesembryanthemum</em>, they are primarily for water-storage. Hairs
protect stomata as well as epidermal cells: the greater number of the former
on the lower surface readily explains the occurrence of a hairy covering on
this surface, even though absent on the more exposed upper side. In some
cases, hairs are developed only where they serve to screen the stomata.</p>

<p class='c007'>The modifications of the stomata with respect to transpiration are numerous,
yet all may be classed with reference to changes of number or level.
With the exception of aquatic and some shade plants, the number of stomata
is normally greater on the less exposed, i. e., lower surface. The number
on both surfaces decreases regularly as the danger of excessive water loss
increases, but the decrease is usually more rapid on the upper surface, which
finally loses its stomata entirely. It has been shown by many observers that
species growing in dry places have fewer stomata to the same area than do
those found in moist habitats. This result has been verified experimentally
by the writer in the case of <em>Ranunculus sceleratus</em>, in which, however, the
upper surface possesses the larger number of stomata. Plants of this
species, which normally grow on wet banks, were grown in water so
that the leaves floated, and in soils containing approximately 10, 15, 30,
and 40 per cent of water. The averages for the respective forms were:
upper 20, lower 0; upper 18, lower 10; upper 18, lower 11; upper 11,
lower 8; upper 10, lower 6. Reduction of number is effective, however,
only under moderate conditions of dryness. As the latter becomes intense,
the guard cells are sunken below the epidermis, either singly or in groups.
In both cases, the protection is the same, the guard cells and the opening
between them being withdrawn from the intense insolation and the dry air.
The sun rays penetrate the chimney-shaped chambers of sunken stomata
only for a few minutes each day, and they are practically excluded from the
stomatal hollows which are filled with hairs. The influence of dry winds is
very greatly diminished, as is also true, though to a less degree, for leaves
in which the stomata are arranged in furrows. Sunken stomata often have
valve-like projections of cuticle which reduce the opening also. Finally, in
a few plants, water loss in times of drouth is almost completely prevented
by closing the opening with a wax excretion.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>Modifications in the chlorenchym.</em> A decrease in the size and number
of the air passages in the leaf renders the movement of water-laden air to
the stomata more difficult, and effects a corresponding decrease in transpiration.
The increase of palisade tissue, though primarily dependent upon
light, reduces the air-spaces, and consequently the amount of water lost.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The development of sclereids below the epidermis likewise hinders the
escape of water. Finally the character of the cell sap often plays an important
part, since cells with high salt-content or those containing mucilaginous
substances give up their water with reluctance.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>164. The increase of water supply.</b> Plants of dry habitats can increase
their absorption only by modifying the root system so that the absorbing
surfaces are carried into the deep-seated layers of soil, and the surfaces in
contact with the dry soil are protected by means of a cortex. Exception
must be made for epiphytes and a few other plants that absorb rain water
and dew through their leaves, and for those desert plants that seem to condense
the moisture of the air by means of hygroscopic salts, and absorb it
through the epidermis of the leaf. The storage of water in the leaf is a
very important device; it increases the water supply by storing the surplus
of absorbed water against the time of need. Modifications for water-storage
are occasionally found in roots and stems, but their chief development
takes place in the leaf. The epidermis frequently serves as a reservoir
for water, either by the use of the epidermal cells themselves, by the
formation of hypodermal water layers, or by means of superficial bulliform
cells. The water cells of the chlorenchym regularly appear in the form of
large clear cells, scattered singly or arranged in groups. In this event,
they occur either as transverse bands, or as horizontal layers, lying between
the palisade and sponge areas, and connecting the bundles. A few plants
possess tracheid-like cells which also serve to store water. In the case of
succulent leaves, practically the whole chlorenchym is used for storing water,
though they owe their ability to withstand transpiration to a combination
of factors.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>165. Modifications due to an excessive water supply.</b> Water plants
with aerial leaf surfaces are modified in such manner as to increase water
loss and to decrease water supply, but the resulting modifications are
rarely striking. There is a marked tendency to increase the exposed surface.
This is indicated by the fact that, while the leaves of mud and floating forms
become larger, they change little or not at all in thickness. The lobing of
leaves is also greatly reduced, or the lobes come to overlap. Leaves of
water plants are practically destitute of all modifications of epidermis and
stomata, which could serve to hinder transpiration. The stomata are
usually more numerous on the upper surface, and in the same species their
number is greater in the forms grown in wet places. These facts explain
in part the extreme development of air-passages in water plants, though this
is, in large measure, a response to the increasing difficulty of aeration. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>increase of air-spaces is correlated with reduction of the palisade, and a
decided increase in the sponge. An increase in water supply is indicated by
the absence of storage tissues, and the reduction of the vascular system,
which, however, is more closely connected with a diminished need for
mechanical support.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>166. Plant types.</b> The necessity for decreasing or increasing water loss
in compensation of the water supply has made it possible to distinguish two
fundamental groups of plants upon the twofold basis of habitat and structure.
These familiar groups, xerophytes and hydrophytes, represent two
extremes of habitat and structure, between which lies a more or less vague,
intermediate condition represented by mesophytes. These show no characteristic
modifications, and it is consequently impossible to arrange them
in subgroups. Xerophytes and hydrophytes, on the other hand, exhibit
marked diversity among themselves, a fact that makes it desirable to
recognize subgroups, which
correspond to fundamental
differences of habitat or
adaptation. It is hardly necessary
to point out that these
types are not sharply defined,
or that a single plastic species
may be so modified as to exhibit
several of them. The
extremes are always clearly
defined, however, and they
indicate the specific tendency of the adaptation shown by other members
of the same group.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>167. Xerophytic types.</b> With the exception of dissophytes, all xerophytes
agree in the possession of a deep-seated root system, adapted to
withdraw water from the lower moist layers, and to conserve from loss
from the upper dry layers. Reservoirs are developed in the root, however,
in relatively few cases. The stem follows the leaf more or less closely in
its modification, except when the leaf is greatly reduced or disappears, in
which event the stem exhibits peculiar adaptations. While the leaf is by
far the most strikingly modified, it is a difficult task to employ it satisfactorily
as the basis for distinguishing types. Several adaptations are often combined
in the same leaf, and it is only where one of these is preeminently
developed, as in the case of succulence, that the plant can be referred to a
definite type. The latter does not happen in many species of the less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>intensely xerophytic habitats, and, consequently, it is difficult, if not undesirable,
to place such xerophytes under a particular group. The best that
can be done is to recognize the types arising from extreme or characteristic
modification, and to connect the less marked forms as closely as possible
with these. Halophytes differ from xerophytes only in the fact that the
chresard is determined by the salt-content of the habitat, and not by the texture
of the soil. In consequence, they should not be treated as a distinct
group.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><b>168. Types of leaf xerophytes.</b>
In these, adaptation has acted
primarily upon the leaf, while
the stem has remained normal for
the most part. Even when the
leaves have become scale-like,
they persist throughout the growing
season, and continue to play
the primary part in photosynthesis.
The following types may
be distinguished:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>The normal form.</em> The
leaf is of the usual dorsiventral
character. In place of a reduction
in size, structural modifications
are used to decrease
transpiration. With respect to
the protective feature that is
predominant, three subtypes may
be recognized. The <em>cutinized</em> leaf
compensates for a low water-content
by means of a thick cuticle,
often reinforced by a high development
of palisade tissue.
Such leaves are more or less
leathery, and they are often evergreen also. <em>Arctostaphylus</em> and many
species of <em>Pentstemon</em> are good examples. Lanate leaves, i. e., those with
dense hairy coverings on one or both surfaces, as <em>Artemisia</em>, <em>Antennaria</em>,
etc., regularly lack both cuticle and palisade tissue. The protection against
water loss, however, is so perfect that the chlorenchym often assumes the
loose structure of a shade leaf. <em>Storage</em> leaves usually have a well-developed
cuticle and several rows of palisade cells, but their characteristic
feature is the water-storage tissue, which maintains a reserve supply of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>water for the time of extreme drouth. Xerophytic species of <em>Helianthus</em>
furnish examples of transverse bundles of storage cells, while those of
<em>Mertensia</em> illustrate the more frequent arrangement in which the water tissue
forms horizontal layers.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>The succulent form.</em> Many succulent leaves are normal in shape and
size, though always thicker than ordinary leaves. Usually, however, they
are reduced in size and are more or less cylindrical in form. The necessary
decrease in transpiration is effected by the reduction in surface, the general
storage of water, a waxy coating, and, often also, by a very thick cuticle.
<em>Agave</em>, <em>Mesembryanthemum</em>, <em>Sedum</em>, and <em>Senecio</em> furnish excellent examples
of this type.</p>

<p>Fig. 34. Diplophyll of <em>Mertensia linearis</em>, showing water cells (chresard, 3–9%, light, 1). × 130.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>The dissected form.</em> The reduction in surface is brought about by
the division of the leaf blade into narrow linear or thread-like lobes which
are widely separated. The
latter are themselves protected
by a hairy covering or a thick
cuticle, which is often supplemented
by many rows of
palisade, or by storage tissue.
<em>Artemisia</em>, <em>Senecio</em>, and <em>Gilia</em>
contain species which serve as
good examples of this type.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>The grass form.</em> Xerophytic
grasses and sedges have
narrow filamentous leaves
with longitudinal furrows
which serve to protect the
stomata. The furrows are
sometimes filled with hairs which are an additional protection, and the
leaves often protect themselves further by rolling up into a thread-like
shape. The elongated subulate leaves of <em>Juncus</em> and certain <em>Cyperaceae</em>
are essentially of this type, although they are usually not furrowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>The needle form.</em> This is the typical leaf of conifers, in which a
sweeping reduction of the leaf surface is an absolute necessity. The relatively
small water loss of the needle leaf is still further decreased by a
thick cuticle, and usually also by hypodermal layers of sclerenchyma.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. <em>The roll form.</em> Roll leaves are frequently small and linear. Their
characteristic feature is produced by the rolling in of the margin on the
under side, by which an almost completely closed chamber is formed for
the protection of the stomata which are regularly confined to the lower
surface of the leaf. The upper epidermis is heavily cutinized and the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>one often protected by hairs. This type is found especially among the
genera of the <em>Ericales</em>, but it also occurs in a large number of related
families.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. <em>The scale form.</em> Reduction of leaf surface for preventing excessive
water loss reaches its logical culmination in the scale leaf characteristic of
many trees and shrubs, e. g., <em>Cupressus</em>, <em>Tamarix</em>, etc. Scale leaves are
leathery in texture, short and broad, and closely appressed to the stem, as
well as often overlapping.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>169. Types of stem xerophytes.</b> In these types the leaves are deciduous
early in the growing period, reduced to functionless scales, or entirely absent.
The functions of the leaf have been assumed by the stem, which exhibits
many of the structural adaptations of the former. Warming<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a> has distinguished
the following groups:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>The phyllode form.</em> The petiole is broadened and takes the place of
the leaf blade which is lacking. In other cases, the stem is flattened or
winged, and it replaces the entire leaf. This type occurs in <em>Acacia</em>,
<em>Baccharis</em>, <em>Genista</em>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>The virgate form.</em> The leaves either fall off early or they are reduced
to functionless scales. The stems are thin, erect, and rod-like, and are often
greatly branched. They are heavily cutinized and palisaded, and the stomata
are frequently in longitudinal furrows. This type is characteristic of the
<em>Genisteae</em>; it is also found in <em>Ephedra</em>, many species of <em>Polygonum</em>,
<em>Lygodesmia</em>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>The rush form.</em> In <em>Heleocharis</em>, many species of <em>Juncus</em>, <em>Scirpus</em>, and
other <em>Cyperaceae</em>, the stem, which is nearly or completely leafless, is cylindrical
and unbranched. It usually possesses also a thick cuticle, and several
rows of dense palisade tissue.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>The cladophyll form.</em> In <em>Asparagus</em> the leaves are reduced to mere
functionless scales, and their function is assumed by the small needle-shaped
branches.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>The flattened form.</em> As in the preceding type, the place of the scale-like
leaves is taken by cladophylls, which are more or less flattened and leaf-like.
<em>Ruscus</em> is a familiar illustration of this form.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. <em>The thorn form.</em> This is typical of many spiny desert shrubs, in which
the leaves are lost very early, or, when present, are mere functionless scales.
The stems have an extremely thick cuticle, and the stomata are deeply
sunken, as a rule. <em>Colletia</em> and <em>Holacantha</em> are good examples of the type.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>7. <em>The succulent form.</em> Plants with succulent stems such as the <em>Cactaceae</em>,
<em>Stapelia</em>, and <em>Euphorbia</em> have not only decreased water loss by extreme
reduction or loss of the leaves, and the reduction of stem surface, but
they also offset transpiration by means of storage tissues containing a mucilaginous
sap. The cuticle is usually highly developed and the stomata
sunken. Thorns and spines are also more or less characteristic features.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>170. Bog plants.</b> Many of the xerophytic types just described are found
in ponds, bogs, and swamps, where the water supply is excessive, and hydrophytes
would be expected. The explanation
that “swamp xerophytes” are due to the
presence of humic acids which inhibit absorption
and aeration in the roots has been
generally accepted. As Schimper has expressed
it, bogs and swamps are “physiologically
dry”, i. e., the available water is small
in amount, in spite of the great total water-content.
Burgerstein (<em>l. c.</em>, 142) has shown,
however, that maize plants transpire, i. e.,
absorb, three times as much water in a solution
of 0.5 per cent of oxalic acid as they do
in distilled water, and that branches of <em>Taxus</em>
in a solution containing 1 per cent of tartaric
acid absorb more than twice as much as in
distilled water. Consequently, it seems improbable
that small quantities of humic acids
should decrease absorption to the extent
necessary for the production of xerophytes in
ponds and bogs. Indeed, in many ponds and
streams, where <em>Heleocharis</em>, <em>Scirpus</em>, <em>Juncus</em>,
etc., grow, not a trace of acid is discoverable.
Furthermore, plants with a characteristic
hydrophytic structure throughout, such as
<em>Ranunculus</em>, <em>Caltha</em>, <em>Ludwigia</em>, <em>Sagittaria</em>,
etc., are regularly found growing alongside of apparent xerophytes. Many
of the latter, furthermore, show a striking contrast in size and vigor of
growth in places where they grow both upon dry gravel banks and in the
water, indicating that the available water-content is much greater in the latter.
Finally, many so-called “swamp xerophytes” possess typically hydrophytic
structures, such as air-passages, diaphragms, etc. In spite of a growing
feeling that the xerophytic features of certain amphibious plants can not
be ascribed to a low chresard in ponds and swamps, a satisfactory explanation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>of them has been found but recently. This explanation has come from
the work of E. S. Clements already cited, in which it was found that certain
sun plants underwent no material structural change when grown in the
shade, and that the same was true also of a few species which grew in two
or more habitats of very different water-content. In accordance with this,
it is felt that the xerophytic features found in amphibious plants are due to
the persistence of stable structures, which were developed when these
species were growing in xerophytic situations. When it is called to mind
that monocotyledons, and especially the grasses, sedges, and rushes, are
peculiarly stable, it may be readily understood how certain ancestral
characters have persisted in spite of a striking change of habitat. Such a
hypothesis can only be confirmed by the methods of experimental evolution,
and a critical study of this sort is now under way.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>171. Hydrophytic types.</b> Hydrophytes permit a fairly sharp division
into three groups, based primarily upon the relation of the leaf surface to
the two media, air and water. In submerged plants, the leaves are constantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>below the water; in amphibious ones, they grow normally in the air.
Floating plants have leaves in which the upper surface is in contact with the
air, and the lower in contact with the water. Transpiration is at a maximum
in the amphibious plant; it is reduced by half in the floating type, and is
altogether absent in submerged plants. Aeration reaches a high development
in amphibious and floating forms, but air-passages are normally absent
from submerged forms except as vestiges. Photosynthesis is marked in the
former, but considerably weakened in the latter. The vascular system,
which attains a moderate development in the amphibious type, is considerably
reduced in floating forms, and it is little more than vestigiate in
submerged ones.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>The amphibious type.</em>
Plants of this type grow in wet
soil or in shallow water. The
leaves are usually large and entire,
the stem well developed, and
the roots numerous and spreading.
In the majority of cases the
leaves are constantly above the
water, but in some species the
lower leaves are often covered,
normally, or by a rise in level,
and they take the form or structure
of submerged leaves. This
is illustrated by <em>Callitriche autumnalis</em>,
<em>Hippuris vulgaris</em>, <em>Ranunculus
delphinifolius</em>, <em>Proserpinaca
palustris</em>, <em>Roripa americana</em>, <em>etc.</em>
The epidermis has a thin cuticle,
or none at all, and is destitute of
hairs. The stomata are numerous
and usually more abundant
on the upper than on the lower surface. The palisade tissue is represented
by one or more well-developed rows, but this portion of the leaf is regularly
thinner than that of the sponge part. The latter contains large air-passages,
or, in the majority of cases, numerous air-chambers, usually provided
with diaphragms. The stems are often palisaded, and are characterized by
longitudinal air-chambers crossed by frequent diaphragms, which extend
downward through the roots.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>The floating type.</em> With respect to form and the structure of the upper
part of the leaf, floating leaves are essentially similar to those of amphibious
plants. They are usually lacquered or coated with wax to prevent the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>stoppage of the stomata by water. Stomata, except as vestiges, are found
only on the upper surface, and the palisade tissue is much less developed
than the sponge, which is uniformly characterized by large air-chambers.
The stems are elongated, the aerating system is enormously developed, and
the supportive tissues are reduced. In the <em>Lemnaceae</em>, the leaf and the
stem are represented by a mere frond or thallus, and the roots are in the
process of disappearance, e. g., <em>Spirodela</em> has several, <em>Lemna</em> one, and
<em>Wolffia</em> none.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>The submerged type.</em> Both stem and root have been greatly reduced
in submerged plants, owing to the generalization of absorption and the
density of the water. The leaves are greatly reduced in size and thickness,
chiefly, it would seem, for the purpose of insuring readier aeration and great
illumination. The leaf may be ribbon-like, linear, cylindrical, or finely
dissected. Stomata are sometimes present, but they are functionless and
vestigial. A distinction into palisade and sponge tissues, when present,
must also be regarded as a vestige; the chlorenchym is essentially that of a
shade leaf. The air-chambers are much reduced, and sometimes lacking;
they function doubtless as reservoirs for air obtained from the water.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>PHOTOHARMOSE</h3>

<h4 class='c018'><em>ADJUSTMENT</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>172. Light as a stimulus.</b> In nature, light stimuli are determined by
intensity and not by quality. A single exception is afforded by those aquatic
habitats where the depth of water is great, and in consequence of which
certain rays disappear by absorption more quickly than others. In forests
and thickets, where the leaves transmit only the green and yellow rays, it
would appear that the light which reaches the herbaceous layers is deficient
in red and violet rays. The amount of light transmitted by an ordinary
sun leaf is so small, however, that it has no appreciable effect upon the
quality of the light beneath the facies, which is diffuse white light that has
passed between the leaves. Indeed, it is only in the densest forests that
distinct sunflecks do not appear. Coniferous forests, with a light value
less than .005, which suffices only for mosses, lichens, and a few flowering plants,
show frequent sunflecks. This is convincing evidence that the light
of such habitats is normal in quality. It warrants the conclusion that in
all habitats with an intensity capable of supporting vascular plants the light,
no matter how diffuse, is white light. The direction of the light ray is of
slight importance in the field, apart from the difference in intensity which
may result from it. In habitats with diffuse light, the latter comes normally
and constantly from above. Likewise, in sunny situations, direction can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>have little influence, since both the direction and the angle of the incident
rays change continually throughout the day, and the position of the leaf
itself is more or less constantly changed by the wind. The influence of
duration upon the character of light stimuli is difficult to determine. There
can be no question that the time during which a stimulus acts has a profound
bearing upon the response that is made to it. In nature the problem
is complicated by the fact that light stimuli are both continuous and
periodic. The duration of sunlight is determined by the periodic return of
night as well as by the irregular occurrence of clouds. Since one is a
regular, and the other at least a normal happening, it is necessary to consider
duration only with respect to the time of actual sunlight on sunny
days, except in the case of formations belonging to regions widely different
in the amount of normal sunshine, i. e., the number of cloudy days. In
consequence, duration is really a question of the intensities which succeed
each other during the day. The differences between these have already been
shown to fall within the efficient difference for light, and for this reason
the ratio between the light intensity of a meadow and of a forest is essentially
the ratio between the sums of light intensity for the two habitats, i. e.,
the duration. The latter is of importance only where there is a daily alternation
between sunshine and shadow, as at the edge of forest and thicket, in
open woodland, etc. In such places duration determines the actual stimulus
by virtue of the sum of preponderant intensities. The periodicity of daylight
is a stimulus to the guard cells of stomata, but its relation to intensity
in this connection is not clear.</p>

<p class='c007'>The amount of change in light intensity necessary to constitute an
efficient stimulus seems to depend upon the existing intensity as well as
upon the plant concerned. Apparently, a certain relative decrease is more
efficient for sun plants than for shade plants. At least, many species sooner
or later reach a point where a difference larger than that which has been
efficient no longer produces a structural response. This has been observed
by E. S. Clements (<em>l. c.</em>) in a number of shade ecads. For example, a
form of <em>Galium boreale</em>, which grew with difficulty in a light value of .002,
showed essentially the leaf structure of the form growing in light of .03,
while the form in full sunlight showed a striking difference in the leaf structure.
In considering the light stimuli of habitats, it is unnecessary to
discuss the stimulus of total darkness upon chlorophyllous plants, although
this is of great importance in experimental evolution and in control experiment.
The normal extremes of light intensity, i. e., those within which
chlorenchym can function, are full sunshine represented by 1, and a diffuseness
of .002, though small flowering plants have once or twice been found
in an intensity of .001. The maximum light value, even on high mountains,
never exceeds 1 by more than an inconsiderable amount, except for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>temporary concentration due to drops of dew, rain, etc. It seems improbable
that the concentrating effect of epidermal papillae can do much more
than compensate for the reflection and absorption of the epidermis. Experimental
study has shown that the maximum intensity in nature may be
increased several, if not many times, without injurious results and without
an appreciable increase in the photosynthetic response, thus indicating
that the efficient difference increases toward the maximum as well as
toward the minimum.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>173. The reception of light stimuli.</b> Rays of light are received by the
epidermis, by which they are more or less modified. Part of the light is
reflected by the outer wall or by the cuticle, particularly when these present
a shining surface. Hairs diffract the light rays, and hairy coverings consequently
have a profound influence in determining stimuli. The walls
and contents of epidermal cells furthermore absorb some of the light,
especially when the cell sap is colored. In consequence of these effects, the
amount of light that reaches the chlorenchym is always less than that incident
upon the leaf, and in many plants, the difference is very great.
According to Haberlandt<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a>, the epidermal cells of some shade plants show
modifications designed to concentrate the light rays. Of such devices, he
distinguishes two types: one in which the outer epidermal wall is arched,
another in which the inner wall is deeply concave. Although there can be
no question of the effect of lens-shaped epidermal cells, their occurrence
does not altogether support Haberlandt’s view. Arched and papillate
epidermal cells are found in sun plants where they are unnecessary for increasing
illumination, to say the least. A large number of shade plants
show cells of this character, but in many the outer wall is practically a
plane. Shade forms of a species usually have the outer wall more arched
or papillate, but this is not always true, and, in a few cases, it is the lower
epidermis alone that shows this feature. Finally, a localization of this
function in certain two-celled papillae, such as Haberlandt indicates for
<em>Fittonia verschaffelti</em>, does not appear to be plausible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epidermis merely receives the light; the perception of the stimulus
normally occurs in those cells that contain chloroplasts. The cytoplasm of
the epidermal cells, as well as that of the chlorenchym cells, is sensitive to
light, but the response produced by the latter is hardly discernible in the
absence of plastids, except in those plants which possess streaming protoplasm.
The daily opening and closing of the stomata, which is due to
light, is evidently connected with the presence of chloroplasts in the guard
cells. Naturally, the perception of light and the corresponding response
occur in the epidermis of many shade and submerged plants which have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>chloroplasts in the epidermal cells. Such cases merely serve to confirm the
view that the perception of light stimuli is localized in the chloroplast. In
conformity with this view, the initial response to such stimuli must be sought
in the chloroplast, and the explanation of all adaptations due to light must
be found in the adjustment shown by the chloroplasts.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>174. Response of the chloroplast.</b> The fundamental response of a
plastid to light is the manufacture of chlorophyll. In the presence of carbon
dioxide and water, leucoplasts invariably make chlorophyll, and chloroplasts
replace that lost by decomposition, in response to the stimulus exerted by
light. The latter is normally the efficient factor, since water is always
present in the living plant, and carbon dioxide absent only locally at most.
Sun plants which possess a distinct cuticle, however, produce leucoplasts,
not chloroplasts, in the epidermal cells, although these are as strongly
illuminated as the guard cells, which contain numerous chloroplasts. This
is evidently explained by the lack of carbon dioxide in the epidermis. This
gas is practically unable to penetrate the compact cuticle, at least in the
small quantity present in the air. The supply obtained through the
stomata is first levied upon by the guard cells and then by the cells of the
chlorenchym, with the result that the carbon dioxide is all used before it
can reach the epidermal cells. This view is also supported by the presence
of chloroplasts along the sides and lower wall of palisade cells, where
there is normally a narrow air-passage, and their absence along the upper
wall when this is closely pressed against the epidermis, as is usually the
case. Furthermore, the leaves of some mesophytes when grown in the
sun develop a cuticle and contain leucoplasts. Under glass and in the
humid air of the greenhouse, the same plants develop epidermal chloroplasts
but no cuticle. This is in entire harmony with the well-known fact that
shade plants and submerged plants often possess chloroplasts in the
epidermis. Although growing in different media, their leaves agree in
the absence of a cuticle, and consequent absorption of gases through the
epidermis. The size, shape, number, and position of the chloroplasts are
largely determined by light, though a number of factors enter in. No
accurate studies of changes in size and shape have yet been made, though
casual measurements have indicated that the chloroplasts in the shade form
of certain species are nearly hemispherical, while those of the sun form are
plane. In the same plants, the number of chloroplasts is strikingly smaller
in the shade form, but exact comparisons are yet to be made. The position
and movement of chloroplasts have been the subject of repeated study, but
the factors which control them are still to be conclusively indicated. Light
is clearly the principal cause, although there are many cases where a marked
change in the light intensity fails to call forth any readjustment of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>plastids. The position of air-spaces as reservoirs of carbon dioxide and the
movement of crude and elaborated materials from cell to cell frequently
have much to do with this problem. Finally, it must be constantly kept in
mind that the chloroplasts lie in the cytoplasm, which is in constant contact
with a cell wall. Hence, any force that affects the shape of the cell will
have a corresponding influence upon the position of the chloroplasts.
When it is considered that in many leaves these four factors play some part
in determining the arrangement of the plastids, it is not difficult to understand
that anomalies frequently appear.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be laid down as a general principle that chloroplasts tend to place
themselves at right angles to rays of diffuse light and parallel to rays of
sunlight. This statement is borne out by an examination of the leaves of
typical sun and shade species, or of sun and shade forms of the same
species. Cells which receive diffuse light, i. e., sponge cells, normally have
their rows of plastids parallel with the leaf surface, while those in full
sunlight place the rows at right angles to the surface. This disposition at
once suggests the generally accepted view that chloroplasts in diffuse light
are placed in such a way as to receive all the light possible, while those in
sunlight are so arranged as to be protected from the intense illumination.
Many facts support this statement with respect to shade leaves, but the need
of protection in the sun leaf is not clearly indicated. The regular occurrence
of normal chloroplasts in the guard cells seems conclusive proof that full
sunlight is not injurious to them. Although the upper wall of the outer
row of palisade cells is usually free from chloroplasts, yet it is not at all uncommon
to find it covered by them. These two conditions are often found
in cells side by side, indicating that the difference is due to the presence
of carbon dioxide and not to light. In certain species of monocotyledons,
the arrangement of the chloroplasts is the same in both halves of the leaf,
and there is no difference between the sun and shade leaves of the same
species. The experimental results obtained with concentrated sunlight,
though otherwise conflicting, seem to show conclusively that full sunlight
does not injure the chloroplasts of sun plants, and that the position of
plastids in palisade cells is not for the purpose of protection. This arrangement,
which is known as <em>apostrophe</em>, is furthermore often found in shade
forms of heliophytes. In typical shade species, and in submerged plants,
the disposition of plastids on the wall parallel with the leaf surface, viz.,
<em>epistrophe</em>, is more regular, but even here there are numerous exceptions
to the rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>The absorption of the light stimulus by the green plastid results, under
normal conditions, in the immediate production of carbohydrates, which in
the vast majority of cases soon become visible as grains of starch. The
appearance of starch in the chloroplasts of flowering plants is such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>regular response to the action of light that it is regarded as the normal indication
of photosynthetic activity. The mere presence of chlorophyll is
not an indication of the latter, since chlorophyll sometimes persists in light
too diffuse for photosynthesis. The amount of starch formed is directly
connected with the light intensity, and in consequence it affords a basis for
the quantitative estimation of the response to light. Two responses to
light stimuli have a
direct effect upon the
amount of transpiration.
Of the light energy
absorbed by the chloroplast,
only 2.5 per cent
is used in photosynthesis,
while 95–98 per
cent is converted into
heat, and brings about
marked increase in transpiration.
Furthermore,
in normal turgid plants,
the direct action of light,
as is well known, opens
the stomata in the morning
and closes them at
night.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>175. Aeration and
translocation.</b> The
movements of gases and
of solutions through the
tissues of the leaf are
intimately connected
with photosynthesis, and
hence with responses to
light stimuli. Aeration
depends primarily upon
the periodic opening of
the stomata, for, while the carbon dioxide and oxygen of the air are able to
pass through epidermal walls not highly cutinized, the amount obtainable
in this manner is altogether inadequate, if not negligible. The development
of sponge tissue or aerenchym is intimately connected with the stomata.
The position and amount of aerenchym and the relative extent of sponge
cells and air-spaces are in part determined by the number and position of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>breathing pores. The disposition of air spaces has much to do with the
arrangement of chloroplasts in both palisade and sponge tissues. Starch
formation is also dependent upon the presence of air spaces, but, contrary
to what would be expected, it seems to be independent of their size,
since sun leaves, which assimilate much more actively than shade leaves,
have the smallest air spaces. From this fact, it appears that the rapidity
of aeration depends very largely upon the rapidity with which the gases are
used. Translocation likewise affects the arrangement of the chloroplasts
and the formation of starch. According to Haberlandt, it also plays the
principal part in determining the form
and arrangement of the palisade cells.
Chloroplasts are regularly absent at those
points of contact where the transfer of
materials is made from cell to cell, though
this is not invariably true. Since air passages
are necessarily absent where cell
walls touch, it is possible that this disposition
of the plastids is likewise due to the
lack of aeration. Translocation is directly
connected with the appearance of starch.
As long as all the sugar made by the
chloroplasts is transferred, no starch appears,
but when assimilation begins to
exceed translocation, the increasing concentration
of the sugar solution results in
the production of starch grains. The
latter is normally the case in all flowering
plants, with the exception of those that
form sugar or oil, but no starch. The
constant action of translocation is practically
indispensable to starch formation,
since an over-accumulation of carbohydrates
decreases assimilation, and finally
inhibits it altogether. In consequence,
translocation occurs throughout the day and night, and by this means the
accumulated carbohydrates of one day are largely or entirely removed
before the next.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>176. The measurement of responses to light.</b> Responses, such as the
periodic opening and closing of stomata, which are practically the same for
all leaves, are naturally not susceptible of measurement. This is also true
of the transpiration produced by light, but the difficulty in this case is due
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>to the impossibility of distinguishing between the water loss due to light
and that caused by humidity and other factors. If it were possible to determine
the amount of chlorophyll or glucose produced, these could be used
as satisfactory measures of response. As it is, they can only be determined
approximately by counting the chloroplasts or starch grains. The arrangement
of the chloroplasts can not furnish the measure sought, since it does
not lend itself to quantitative methods, and since the relation to light intensity
is too inconstant. Hesselmann (<em>l. c.</em>, 400) has determined the
amount of carbon dioxide respired, by means of a eudiometer, and has based
comparisons of sun and shade plants upon the results. As he points out,
however, light has no direct connection with respiration. Although the
latter increases necessarily with increased nutrition, the relation between
them is so obscure, and so far from exact, that the amount of respiration
can in no wise serve as a measure of the response to light. As a result of
the foregoing, it is clear that no functional response is able to furnish a
satisfactory measure of adjustment to light, though one or two have perhaps
sufficient value to warrant their use. Indeed, structural adaptations
offer a much better basis for the quantitative determination of the effects
of light stimuli, as will be shown later.</p>

<p class='c007'>In attempting to use the number of chloroplasts or starch grains as a
measure of response, the study should be confined to the sun and shade
forms of the same species, or, in some cases, to the forms of closely related
species. The margin of error is so great and the connection with light
sufficiently remote that comparisons between unrelated forms or species
are almost wholly without value. It has already been stated that starch is
merely the surplus carbohydrate not removed by translocation; the amount
of starch, even if accurately determined, can furnish no real clue to the
amount of glucose manufactured. In like manner, the number of chloroplasts
can furnish little more than an approximation of the amount of
chlorophyll, unless size and color are taken into account. In sun and shade
ecads of the same species, the general functional relations are essentially
the same, and whatever differences appear may properly be ascribed to
different light intensities for the two habitats. The actual counting of
chloroplasts and starch grains is a simple task. Pieces of the leaves of the
two or more forms to be compared are killed and imbedded in paraffin in
the usual way. To save time, the staining is done <em>in toto</em>. Methyl green is
used for the chloroplasts and a strong solution of iodine for the starch
grains. When counts are to be made of both, the leaves are first treated
with iodin and then stained with the methyl green. The thickness of the
microtome sections should be less than that of the palisade cells in order
that the chloroplasts may appear in profile, thus facilitating the counting.
The count is made for a segment 100 μ in width across the entire leaf.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Two segments in different parts of the section are counted, and the result
multiplied by five to give the number for a segment 1 millimeter in width.
Although sun and shade leaves regularly differ in size and thickness, no
correction is necessary for these. Size and thickness stand in reciprocal
relation to each other in ecads, and thickness is largely an expression of
the absorption of light, and hence of its intensity. In the gravel, forest, and
thicket ecads of <em>Galium boreale</em>, counts of the chloroplasts gave the following
results. The gravel form (light 1) showed 3,500 plastids in the 1–mm.
segment, the forest form (light .03) possessed 1,350, and the thicket form
(light .002), 1,000. In these no attention was paid to the size and form
of the plastids in the different leaves, since the differences were inappreciable.
When this is not the case, both factors should be taken into account.
Starch grains are counted in exactly the same way. Indeed, if care is taken
to collect leaves of forms to be compared, at approximately the same time
on sunshiny days, a count of the chloroplasts is equivalent to a count of the
starch grains in the vast majority of cases. Measurements of the size of
starch grains can be made with accuracy only when the leaves are killed in
the field at the same time, preferably in the afternoon. Counts of chloroplasts
alone can be used as measures of response in plants that produce
sugar or oil, while either chloroplasts or starch grains or both may be
made the basis in starch-forming leaves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hesselmann (<em>l. c.</em>, 379) has employed Sachs’s iodine test as a measure
of photosynthesis. This has the advantage of permitting macroscopic examination,
but the comparison of the stained leaves can give only a very
general idea of the relative photosynthetic activity of two or more ecads.
The iodine test is made as follows:<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a> fresh leaves are placed for a few
minutes in boiling water, and then in 95 per cent alcohol for 2–5 minutes,
in order to remove the chlorophyll and other soluble substances. The leaves
are placed in the iodine solution for ½–3 hours, or until no further change
in color takes place. The strength of the solution is not clearly indicated
by Sachs, who says: “I used an alcoholic solution of iodin which is best
made by dissolving a large quantity of iodin in strong alcohol and adding
to this sufficient distilled water to give the liquid the color of dark beer.”
This solution may be approximated by dissolving ⅓ gram of iodin in 100
grams of 30 per cent alcohol. The stained leaves are put in a white porcelain
dish filled with distilled water, and the dish placed in the strong
diffuse light of a window. The colored leaf stands out sharply against the
porcelain, and the degree of coloration, and hence of starch content, is
determined by the following table:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>

<h4 class='c018'><em>ADAPTATION</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>177. Influence of chloroplasts upon form and structure.</b> The beginning
of all modifications produced by light stimuli must be sought in the
chloroplast as the sensitized unit of the protoplasm. Hence, it seems a
truism to say that the number and arrangement of the chloroplasts determine
the form of the cell, the tissue, and the leaf, although it has not
yet been possible to demonstrate this connection conclusively by means of
experiment. In spite of the lack of experimental proof, this principle is
by far the best guide through the subject of adaptations to light, and in
the discussion that follows, it is the fundamental hypothesis upon which all
others rest. The three propositions upon which this main hypothesis is
grounded are: (1) that the number of chloroplasts increases with the intensity
of the light; (2) that in shaded habitats chloroplasts arrange themselves
so as to increase the surface for receiving light; (3) that chloroplasts
in sunny habitats place themselves in such fashion as to decrease the surface,
and consequently the transpiration due to light. In these, there can be
little doubt concerning the facts of number and arrangement, since they
have been repeatedly verified. The purpose of epistrophe and apostrophe,
however, can not yet be stated with complete certainty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stimulus of sunlight and of diffuse light is the same in one respect,
namely, the chloroplasts respond by arranging themselves in rows or lines
on the cell wall. The direct consequence of this is to polarize the cell, and
its form changes from globoid to oblong. This effect is felt more or less
equally by both palisade and sponge cells, but the disturbing influence of
aeration has caused the polarity of the cells to be much less conspicuous in
the sponge than in the palisade tissue. While the cells of both are typically
polarized, however, they assume very different positions with reference to
incident light. This position is directly dependent upon the arrangement of
the plastids as determined by the light intensity. In consequence, palisade
cells stand at right angles to the surface and parallel with the impinging
rays; the sponge cells, conversely, are parallel with the epidermis and at
right angles to the light ray. Some plants, especially monocotyledons,
exhibit little or no polarity in the chlorenchym. As a result the leaf does
not show a differentiation into sponge and palisade, and the leaves of sun
and shade ecads are essentially alike in form and structure. The form of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the leaf is largely determined by the chloroplasts acting through the cells
that contain them. A preponderance of sponge tissue produces an extension
of leaf in the direction determined by the arrangement of the plastids and
the shape of the sponge cells, viz., at right angles to the light. Shade leaves
are in consequence broader and thinner, and sometimes larger, than sun
leaves of the same species. A preponderance of palisade likewise results
in the extension of the leaf in the line of the plastids and the palisade cells,
i. e., in a direction parallel with the incident ray. In accordance, sun leaves
are thicker, narrower, and often smaller than shade leaves.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>178. Form of leaves and stems.</b> In outline, shade leaves are more
nearly entire than sun leaves. This statement is readily verified by the
comparison of sun and shade ecads, though the rule is by no means without
exceptions. In the leaf prints shown in figures 14 and 15, the modification
of form is well shown in <em>Bursa</em> and <em>Thalictrum</em>; in <em>Capnoides</em> the change
is less evident, while in <em>Achilleia</em> and <em>Machaeranthera</em> lobing is more pronounced
in the shade form, a fact which is, however, readily explained when
other factors are taken into account. The leaf prints cited serve as more
satisfactory examples of the increase of size in consequence of an increase
in the surface of the shade leaf, although the leaves printed were selected
solely with reference to thickness and size or outline. In all comparisons
of this kind, however, the relative size and vigor of the two plants must be
taken into account. This precaution is likewise necessary in the case of
thickness, which should always be considered in connection with amount of
surface. The relation between surface and thickness is shown by the following
species, in all of which the size of the leaf is greater in the shade than in
the sun. In <em>Capnoides aureum</em>, the thickness of the shade leaf is ½ (6 : 12)
that of the sun leaf; in <em>Galium boreale</em> the ratio is 5 : 12, and in <em>Allionia
linearis</em> it is 3 : 12. The ratio in <em>Thalictrum sparsiflorum</em> is 9 : 12, and in
<em>Machaeranthera aspera</em> 11 : 12. The thickness of sun and shade leaves of
<em>Bursa bursa-pastoris</em> is as 14 : 12, but this anomaly is readily explained by
the size of the plants; the shade form is ten times larger than the sun
form. Certain species, e. g., <em>Erigeron speciosus</em>, <em>Potentilla bipinnatifida</em>,
etc., show no change in thickness and but little modification in size or outline.
They furnish additional evidence of a fundamental principle in
adaptation, namely that the amount of structural response is profoundly
affected by the stability of the ancestral type.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of diffuse light in causing stems to elongate, though known for
a long time, is still unexplained. The old explanation that the plant stretches
up to obtain more light seems to be based upon nothing more than the coincidence
that the light comes from the direction toward which the stem
grows. Later researches have shown that the stretching of the stem is due
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>to the excessive elongation of the parenchyma cells, but the cause of the
latter is far from apparent. It is generally assumed to be due to a lack of
the tonic action of sunlight, which brings about a retardation of growth in
sun plants. The evidence in
favor of this view is not conclusive,
and it seems probable
at least that the elongation of
the parenchyma cells takes
place under conditions which
favor the mechanical stretching
of the cell wall, but inhibit
the proper growth of the wall
by intussusception. It is
hardly necessary to state that
the reduced photosynthetic activity
of shade plants favors
such an explanation. Whatever
the cause, the advantage
that results from the elongation
of the internodes is apparent.
Leaves interfere less with the
illumination of those below
them, and the leaves of the
branches are carried away
from the stem in such a way as
to give the plant the best possible
exposure for its aggregate
leaf surface.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>179. Modification of the
epidermis.</b> The development
of epidermal chloroplasts in
diffuse light is the only change
which is due to the direct effect
of light. This does not often
occur in the shade ecads of
sun species, but chloroplasts
are regularly present in the
epidermis of woodland ferns
and of submerged plants. The
slight development of hairs in sciophilous plants is an advantage, but it
must be referred to the factors that determine water loss. The significance
of epidermal papillae in increasing the absorption of light by shade plants
has already been discussed. The questions as to what factor has called forth
these papillae and what purpose they serve must still be regarded as unsettled.
The increased size of the epidermal cells, which is a fairly constant
feature of shade ecads, seems to be for the purpose of increasing translocation
and transpiration, and to bear no relation to light. The extreme
development of the cells of the epidermis in <em>Streptopus</em> and <em>Limnorchis</em>,
which grow at the edge of mountain brooks, has been plausibly explained
by E. S. Clements as a contrivance to increase water loss. The presence
of a waxy coating, such as that
found upon the leaves of <em>Impatiens
aurea</em> and <em>I. pallida</em>, is
clearly to prevent the wetting
of the leaf and the consequent
stoppage of the stomata. In
regard to the latter, different
observers have noted that the
number of the stomata is
greater in sun than in shade
leaves. This holds generally
for sun and shade species, but
it is most clearly indicated by
different ecads of the same
species. In <em>Scutellaria brittonii</em>,
the sun form possesses
100 stomata per square millimeter,
but in the shade these
are reduced to 40 per square
millimeter; the sun leaf of <em>Allionia
linearis</em> has 180 stomata
to the square millimeter, the
shade leaf 90. In the stable
leaf of <em>Erigeron speciosus</em>,
however, the number of stomata is the same, 180 per square millimeter, for
sunlight and for diffuse light. The presence of the larger number of
stomata in the plant exposed to greater loss, which at first thought seems
startling, is readily explained by the more intense photosynthetic activity
in the sun. Since the absorption of gases is the primary function of the
stomata, and transpiration merely secondary, it is evident that sun plants
must have more stomata than shade plants. This is further explained by
the fact that the small air passages of sun leaves necessitate frequent inlets,
which are less necessary in shade leaves with their larger air spaces. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>shade plants, moreover, the decrease in the number is compensated in some
measure by the ability of the epidermal cells to absorb gases directly
from the air.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>180. The differentiation of the chlorenchym.</b> The division of the
chlorenchym into two tissues, sponge and palisade, is the normal consequence
of the unequal illumination of the leaf surfaces. Exceptions to this
rule occur only in certain monocotyledons, in which the leaf tissue consists
of sponge-like cells throughout, and in those stable species that retain more
or less palisade in spite of their change to diffuse light. The difference in
the illumination of the two surfaces is determined by the position of the
leaf. Leaves that are erect or nearly so usually have both sides about equally
illuminated, and they may be termed isophotic. Leaves that stand more
or less at right angles to the
stem receive much more light
upon the upper surface than
upon the lower, and may accordingly
be termed diphotic.
Certain dorsiventral leaves,
however, absorb practically as
much light on the lower side
as upon the upper. This is
true of sun leaves with a dense
hairy covering, which screens
out the greater part of the
light incident upon the upper
surface. It occurs also in
xerophytes which grow in
light-colored sands and gravels
that serve to reflect the sun’s
rays upon the lower surface. In deep shade, moreover, there is no essential
difference in the intensity of the light received by the two surfaces, and
shade leaves are often isophotic in consequence. From these examples it
is evident that isophotic and diphotic leaves occur in both sun and shade,
and that the intensity of the light is secondary to direction, in so far as the
modification of the leaf is concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The essential connection of sponge tissue with diffuse light is conclusively
shown by the behavior of shade ecads, but further evidence of great
value is furnished by diphotic leaves, and those with hairy coverings. The
sponge tissue, which in the shade leaf is due to the diffuse light of the
habitat, is produced in the hairy leaf as a consequence of the absorption and
diffraction of the light by the covering. In ordinary diphotic leaves, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>absorption of light in the palisade reduces the intensity to such a degree
that the cells of the lower half of the leaf are in diffuse light, and are in
consequence modified to form sponge tissue. The sponge tissue of the
diphotic leaf is just as clearly an adaptation to diffuse light as it is in
those plants where the whole chlorenchym is in the shade of other plants
or of a covering of hairs. As is indicated later, all these relations permit of
ready confirmation by experiment, either by changing the position of the
leaf or by modifying the intensity or direction of the light.</p>

makes it fairly clear that
sponge tissue is developed
primarily to increase the light-absorbing
surface. Because
of its direct connection with
photosynthesis, the sponge tissue
is the especial organ of
aeration, also, and since it
shows a high development of
air spaces for this purpose, it
is inevitably concerned in
transpiration. It seems to be
partly a coincidence, however,
that the sponge is found next
to the lower surface upon
which the stomata are most
numerous. This is indicated
by artificial ecads of <em>Ranunculus
sceleratus</em>, in which
sponge tissue is unusually developed,
although the stomata
are much more numerous upon
the upper surface. Palisade
tissue is apparently developed
primarily as a protection against water loss, particularly that due to the
absorption of light by the chloroplast. The small size of the intercellular
passages between palisade cells likewise aids in decreasing transpiration.
The fact that leaves with much palisade tissue transpire twice as much as
shade leaves is hardly an objection to this view, as Hesselmann
(<em>l. c.</em>, 442) would think. It is readily explained by the intense photosynthesis
of sun plants, which makes necessary an increase, usually a doubling,
in the number of stomata, in consequence of which the transpiration is
increased.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>181. Types of leaves.</b> Isophotic leaves are equally illuminated and
possess more or less uniform chlorenchym. Diphotic leaves are unequally
illuminated, and exhibit a differentiation into palisade and sponge tissues.
They may be distinguished as isophotophylls and diphotophylls respectively.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c017'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
Isophotic leaves fall into three
types based upon the intensity of the light.
The staurophyll, or palisade leaf, is a sun
type in which the equal illumination is due
to the upright position or to the reflection
from a light soil, and in which the chlorenchym
consists wholly of rows of palisade
cells. The diplophyll is a special form of
this type in which the intense light does not
penetrate to the middle of the leaf, thus resulting
in a central sponge tissue, or water-storage
tissue. The spongophyll, or sponge
leaf, is regularly a shade type; the chlorenchym
consists of sponge cells alone. For
the present at least it is also necessary to
refer to this group those monocotyledons
which grow in the sun but contain no palisade
tissue. Diphotic leaves always contain
both palisade and sponge, though the ratio
between them varies considerably. Diphotophylls
are characteristic of sunny mesophytic habitats. They are
frequent in xerophytic habitats
as well as in woodlands
where the light is not too
diffuse. In the case of stable
species, this type of structure
sometimes persists in the diffuse
light of coniferous forests.
Floating leaves, in which the
light is almost completely cut
off from the lower surface, are
also members of this group.
Submerged leaves, on the other
hand, are spongophylls.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>182. Heliophytes and sciophytes.</b> The great majority of sun plants
possess diphotophylls. This type is represented by <em>Pedicularis procera</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>(fig. 32). Plants with isophotophylls are found chiefly in xerophytic places,
though erect leaves of this type occur in most sunny habitats. The
staurophyll, in which the protection is due to the extreme development of
palisade tissue, is illustrated by <em>Allionia linearis</em> (fig. 40) and <em>Bahia dissecta</em>
(fig. 33). The diplophyll, which is characterized by a central band of
sponge tissue or storage cells, is found in <em>Mertensia linearis</em> (fig. 34). The
form of the spongophyll that is found in certain monocotyledons is shown
by <em>Gyrostachys stricta</em> (fig. 45). The spongophyll (fig. 38:3, 39:2) is
frequent among plants of deep shade, but as the leaf sections of <em>Allionia</em>
(figs. 38, 40) and <em>Quercus</em> (fig. 42) show, the diphotophyll is the rule in
shade ecads.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><span class='sc'>Experimental Evolution</span></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>183. Scope.</b> The primary task of experimental evolution is the detailed
study, under measured conditions, of the origin of new forms in
nature. As a department of botanical research that is as yet unformed, it
has little concern with the host of hypotheses and theories which rest
merely upon general observation and conjecture. A few of these constitute
good working hypotheses or serve to indicate possible points of attack, but
the vast majority are worthless impedimenta which should be thrown away
at the start. It is the general practice to speak of evolution as founded upon
a solid basis of incontestible facts, but a cursory examination of the evidence
shows that it is drawn, almost without exception, from observation alone,
and has in consequence suffered severely from interpretation. With the
exception of De Vries’s work on mutation, sustained and accurate investigation
of the evolution of plants has been lacking. As a result, botanical
research has been built high upon an insecure foundation, nearly every stone
of which must be carefully tested before it can be left permanently in place.
In a field so vast and important as evolution, experiment should far outrun
induction, and deduction should enter only when it can show the way to a
working hypothesis of real merit. The great value of De Vries’s study of
mutation as an example of the proper experimental study of evolution has
been seriously reduced by the fact that the “mutation theory” has carried
induction far beyond the warrant afforded by experiment. The investigator
who plans to make a serious study by experiment of the origin of new plant
forms should rest secure in the conviction that the most rapid and certain
progress can be made only by the accumulation of a large number of unimpeachable
facts, obtained by the most exact methods of experimental
study.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general application of field experiment to evolution will render the
current methods of recognizing species quite useless. It will become imperative
to establish an experimental test for forms and species, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>apply this test critically to every “new species.” Descriptive botany, as
practiced at present, will fall into disuse, as scientific standards come to
prevail, and in its place will appear a real science of taxonomy. In the latter
the criteria upon which species are based will be obtained solely by
experiment.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>184. Fundamental lines of inquiry.</b> There are two primary and
sharply defined fields of research in experimental evolution, namely, adaptation
in consequence of variation (and mutation), and hybridization. The
latter constitutes a particular field of inquiry, which is not intimately connected
with the problems of evolution in nature. In the study of specific
adaptation, two questions of profound importance appear. One deals with
the effects of ancestral fixity or plasticity in determining the amount of
modification produced by the habitat. These are fundamental problems,
and a solution of them can not be hoped for until exact and trustworthy data
have been provided by numerous experimental researches. It thus becomes
clear that the principal, if not the sole task of experimental evolution for
years to come is the diligent prosecution of accurate and prolonged experiment
in the modification of plant forms. It seems inevitable that this will
be carried on along the lines that have already been indicated. Plants will
be grown in habitats of measured value, or in different intensities of the
same factor. The relation between stimulus and adjustment will form the
basis of careful quantitative study, and the final expression of this relation
in structural modifications will find an exact record in drawings, photographs,
exsiccati, and biometrical measures. The making of an accurate
and complete record of the whole course of each experiment of this sort
is an obligation that rests upon every investigator. Studies in experimental
evolution will prove time-consuming beyond all other lines of botanical
research, and the work of one generation should appear in a record so
perfect that it can be used without doubt or hesitation as a basis for the
studies of the succeeding generation.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>185. Ancestral form and structure.</b> The significance of the fact that
some species have been found to remain unaltered structurally under changes
of habitats that produced striking modifications in others has already been
commented upon. It is hardly necessary to indicate the important bearing
which this has upon evolution. The very ability of a plant to undergo
modification, and hence to give rise to new forms, depends upon the degree
of fixity of the characters which it has inherited. Stable plants are less
susceptible of evolution than plastic ones. The latter adapt themselves to
new habitats with ease, and in each produce a new form, which may serve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>as the starting point of a phylum. There is at present no clue whatever as
to what calls forth this essential difference in behavior. This is not surprising
in view of the fact that there have been no comparative experimental
studies of stable and plastic species. Until these have been made, it is impossible
to do more than to formulate a working hypothesis as to the effect
of stability, and an explanation of the forces which cause or control it is
altogether out of the question.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>186. Variation and mutation.</b> New forms of plants are known to arise
by three methods, viz., variation, mutation, adaptation. The evidence in
support of these is almost wholly observational, and consequently more or
less inexact, but for each there exist a few accurate experiments which
are conclusive. Origin by variation and subsequent selection is the essence
of the Darwinian theory of the origin of species. According to this
the appearance of a new form is due to the accumulation, and selection,
through a long period, of minute differences which prove advantageous to
the plant in its competition with others in nature, or are desirable under
cultivation. Slight variations appear indiscriminately in every species.
Their cause is not known, but since they are found even in the most uniform
habitats, it is impossible to find any direct connection between them and the
physical factors. In the case of origin by mutation, the new form appears
suddenly, with definite characteristics fully developed. Selection, in the
usual sense of the term, does not enter into mutation at all, though the
persistence of the new form is still to be determined by competition. Mutations
are known at present for only a few species, and their actual appearance
has been studied in a very few cases. Like variations, they are indiscriminate
in character. The chief difference between them is apparently one of
degree. Indeed, mutation lends itself readily to the hypothesis that it is
simply the sudden appearance of latent variations which have accumulated
within the plant. De Vries regards constancy as an essential feature of
mutation, but the evidence from the mutants of <em>Onagra</em> is not convincing.
Indeed, while there can be no question of the occurrence of mutation in
plants, a fact known for many years, the facts so far brought forward in
support of the “mutation theory” fall far short of proving “the lack of
significance of individual variability, and the high value of mutability for
the origin of species.”<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Mutations do not show any direct connection with
the habitat, but their sudden appearance suggests that they may be latent
or delayed responses to the ordinary stimuli. Origin by adaptation is the
immediate consequence of the stimuli exerted by the physical factors of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>habitat. This fact distinguishes it from origin by variation, or by mutation.
The new form may appear suddenly, often in a single generation, or gradually,
but in either case it is the result of adaptation that is necessarily
advantageous, because it is the result of adjustment to controlling physical
factors. Origin by adaptation is perhaps only a special kind of origin by
variation, but this might be said with equal truth of mutation. New forms
resulting from adaptation are like those produced from mutation, in that
they appear suddenly as a rule and without the agency of selection. They
are essentially different, inasmuch as their cause may be found at once in
the habitat, and since a reversal of stimuli produces, in many cases at
least, a reversion in form and structure to the ancestral type.</p>

<p class='c007'>A valid distinction between forms or species upon the basis of constancy
is impracticable at the present time. It is doubtful that such a distinction can
ever be made in anything like an absolute sense, since all degrees of fluctuation
may be observed between constancy and inconstancy. In all events,
it is gratuitous to make constancy the essential criterion in the present state
of our knowledge. So little is certainly known of it that it is equally unscientific
to affirm or to deny its value, and even a tentative statement can
not be ventured until a vast amount of evidence has been obtained from experiment.
Accordingly, there is absolutely no warrant, other than tradition,
for limiting the term species to a constant group. In the evolutionary sense,
a species is the aggregate ancestral group and the new forms which have
sprung from it by variation, mutation, or adaptation. It should not be
regarded as an isolated unit for purposes of descriptive botany; indeed,
its use in this connection is purely secondary. It is properly the unit to
be used in indicating the primary relationships which are the result of
evolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the basis of their actual behavior in the production of new forms,
species may be distinguished as variable, mutable, or adaptable. The new
form which results from variation is a <em>variant</em>; the product of mutation is
a <em>mutant</em>, and that of adaptation, an <em>ecad</em>. The following examples serve
to illustrate these distinctions. <em>Machaeranthera canescens</em>, judging from
the numerous minute intergrades between its many forms, is a variable
species, i. e., one in which forms are arising by the gradual selection of
small variations. It apparently comprises a large number of variants,
<em>M. canescens aspera</em>, <em>superba</em>, <em>ramosa</em>, <em>viscosa</em>, etc. <em>Onagra lamarckiana</em>
is a mutable species: it comprises many mutants, e. g., <em>Onagra lamarckiana
gigas</em>, <em>O. l. nanella</em>, <em>O. l. lata</em>, etc. <em>Galium boreale</em> is an adaptable species:
it possesses one distinct ecad, <em>Galium boreale hylocolum</em>, which is the shade
form of the species.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span><b>187. Methods.</b> The best of all experiments in evolution are those that
are constantly being made in nature. Such experiments are readily discovered
and studied in the case of origin by adaptation; variants present
much greater difficulties, while mutants are very rare under natural conditions.
The method which makes use of these experiments may be termed
the <em>method of natural experiment</em>. The number of ecads which appear
naturally in vegetation is limited, however, and it is consequently very
desirable to produce them artificially, by the <em>method of habitat culture</em>.
This method, while involving more labor than the preceding, yields results
that are equally conclusive, and permits the study of practically every
species. The <em>method of control culture</em>, which is carried on in the planthouse,
naturally does not possess the fundamental value of the field methods.
It is an invaluable aid to the latter, however, since it permits the physical
factors to be readily modified and controlled. All these methods are based
on the indispensable use of instruments for the measurement of physical
factors.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>METHOD OF NATURAL EXPERIMENT</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>188. Selection of species.</b> Species that are producing variants or ecads
are found everywhere in nature; those which give rise to mutants seem,
however, to be extremely rare. Consequently, mutants can not be counted
upon for experimental work, and their study scarcely needs to be considered.
When a mutant is discovered by some fortunate chance, the
mutable species from which it has sprung, and related species as well,
should be subjected to the most critical surveillance, in the hope that new
mutants will occur or the original one reappear. On account of the suddenness
with which they appear, mutants do not lend themselves readily to
natural experiment, and after they have once been discovered, inquiry into
the causes and course of mutation is practicable only by means of habitat
and control cultures. Among variable species, those are most promising
that show a wide range of variation and are found in abundance over
extensive areas. A species which occurs in widely separated, or more or
less isolated areas, furnishes especially favorable material for investigation,
since distance or physical barriers partly eliminate the leveling due to constant
cross-fertilization. The individuals or groups which show appreciable
departure from the type are marked and observed critically from year to
year. The direction of the variation and the rapidity with which small
changes are accumulated can best be determined by biometrical methods.
Representative individuals of the species and each of its variants should
likewise be selected from year to year. After being photographed, these are
preserved as exsiccati, and with the photographs constitute a complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>graphic record of the course of variation. When the latter is made evident
in structural feature also, histological slides are an invaluable part of the
record.</p>

<p class='c007'>Polydemic species are by far the best and most frequent of all natural
experiments. In addition to plants that are strictly polydemic, i. e., grow
in two or more distinct habitats, there are a large number which occur in
physically different parts of the same habitat. The recognition of polydemics
is the simplest of tasks. As a rule, it requires merely a careful examination
of contiguous formations in order to ascertain the species common to two
or more of them. The latter are naturally most abundant along the ecotones
between the habitats, and, as a result, transition areas and mixed
formations are almost inexhaustible sources of ecads. Many adaptable
species are found throughout several formations, however, and such are
experiments of the greatest possible value. Not infrequently species of the
manuals are seen to be ecads, in spite of their systematic treatment, and to
constitute natural experiments that can be readily followed. Finally, it
must be kept in mind that some polydemics are stable, and do not give rise
to ecads by structural adaptation. They not only constitute extremely interesting
experiments in themselves, but they should also be very carefully
followed year by year, since it seems probable that the responses are merely
latent, and that they will appear suddenly in the form of mutants. In
natural experiments it is sometimes difficult to distinguish which form is the
ecad and which the original form of the species. As a rule, however, this
point can be determined by the relative abundance and the distribution, but
in cases of serious doubt, it is necessary to appeal to experimental cultures.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although habitats differ more or less with respect to all their factors, the
study of polydemics needs to take into account only the direct factors,
water-content, humidity, and light. Humidity as a highly variable factor
plays a secondary part, and in consequence the search for ecads may be
entirely confined to those habitats that show efficient differences in the
amount of water-content or of light. Temperature, wind, etc., do not produce
ecads, and may be ignored, except in so far as they affect the direct
factors. Complexes of factors, such as altitude, slope, and exposure, are
likewise effective only through the action of the component simple factors
upon water and light. The influence of biotic factors is so remote as to
be negligible, especially in view of the fact that ecads are necessarily
favorable adaptations, and are in consequence little subject to selective
agencies. The essential test of a habitat is the production of a distinguishable
ecad, but a knowledge of the water-content and light values of the
habitats under examination is a material aid, since a minute search of each
formation is necessary to reveal all the ecads. It is evident that habitats or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>areas that do not show efficient differences of water or light will contain no
ecads of their common species, and also that extreme differences in the
amount of either of these two factors will preclude origin by adaptation to
a large degree, on account of the need for profound readjustment. The
general rule followed by most polydemics is that sun species will give rise
to shade forms, and vice versa, and that xerophytes will produce forms of
hydrophytic tendency, or the converse, when the areas concerned are not too
remote, and the water or light differences are efficient, but not inhibitive.
Some species are capable of developing naturally two series of ecads, one
in response to light, the other to water-content, but they, unfortunately, have
been found to be rare. Greatly diversified regions, such as the Rocky
mountains, in which alternation is a peculiarly striking feature of the vegetation,
are especially favorable to the production of ecads, and hence for the
study of natural experiments in origin by adaptation.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>189. Determination of factors.</b> For the critical investigation of the
origin of new forms, an exact knowledge of the factors of the habitat, both
physical and biotic, is imperative. In the case of variable species, these
factors determine what variations are of advantage, and thereby the direction
in which the species can develop. They are the agents of selection.
With mutants, the factors of the habitat are apparently neither causative
nor selective, though it seems probable that further study of mutants will
show an essential connection between mutant and factor. In any event, the
persistence of a mutant in nature, and its corresponding ability to initiate
new lines of development, is as much dependent upon the selection exerted
by physical and biotic factors as is the origin of variants. Physical factors
are causative agents in the production of ecads, as has been shown at length
elsewhere. The form and structure of the ecad are the ultimate responses
to the stimuli of light or water-content, and the quantitative determination
of the latter is accordingly of the most fundamental importance. The measurement
of factors has been treated so fully in the preceding chapters that
it is only necessary to point out that the thorough investigation of habitats
by instruments is as indispensable for the study of experimental evolution as
for that of the development and structure of the formation. Furthermore,
it is evident that a knowledge of physical factors is as imperative for habitat
and control cultures as for the method of natural experiment. In the latter,
however, the biotic factors demand unusual attention, since pollination, isolation,
etc., are often decisive factors in origin by variation and in the persistence
of mutants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Measurements of adjustment, i. e., functional response to the direct
factor concerned, are extremely valuable, but not altogether indispensable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to research in experimental evolution. This is due to the fact that a knowledge
of adjustment is important in tracing the origin of new forms only
when adjustment is followed by adaptation, and in all such cases the ratio
between the two processes seems to be more or less constant. In the present
rudimentary development of the subject, however, it is very desirable to
make use of all methods of measuring functional responses to water and
light that are practicable in the field. Certain methods that are difficult of
application in nature may be used to advantage in control cultures, and the
results thus secured can be used to interpret those obtained from natural
experiments and field cultures.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>190. Method of record.</b> As suggested elsewhere, there are four important
kinds of records, which should be made for natural experiments,
and likewise for habitat and control cultures. These are exsiccati, photographs,
biometrical formulae and curves, and histological sections. These
serve not merely as records of what has taken place, but they also make it
possible to trace the course of evolution through a long period with an
accuracy otherwise impossible, and even to foreshadow the changes which
will occur in the future. The possibility of doing this depends primarily
upon the completeness of the record, and for this reason the four methods
indicated should be used conjointly. In the case of ecads and mutants,
exsiccati, photographs, and sections are the most valuable, and in the majority
of cases are sufficient, since both ecads and mutants bear a more
distinctive impress than variants do. On the other hand, since variations
are more minute, the determination of the mean and extreme of variation
by biometrical methods is almost a prerequisite to the use of the other three
methods, which must necessarily be applied to representative individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Exsiccati and photographs are made in the usual way for plants, but it
is an advantage to photograph each ancestral form alongside of its proper
ecads, mutants, or variants, in addition to making detail pictures of each
form and of the organs which show modification. In the collection of
material for histological sections, which deal primarily with the leaf or with
stems in the case of plants with reduced leaves, a few simple precautions
have been found necessary. Whenever possible, material should be killed
where it is collected, since in this way the chloroplasts are fixed in their
normal position. In case leaves that can not be replaced easily have become
wilted, an immersion of 5–6 hours in water will make it possible to kill them
without shrinkage. In selecting leaves, great pains must be taken to collect
only mature leaves. When the plants have a basal rosette, or distinct
radical leaves, mature leaves are taken from both stem and base. In all cases
where the two surfaces of the leaf can not be readily distinguished, the
upper one is clearly marked.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>METHOD OF HABITAT CULTURES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>191. Scope and advantages.</b> By means of experiments actually made
in the field, practically every species that is capable of modification can be
made to produce new forms, the origin of which can be traced in the manner
already indicated. Field experiments of this sort are especially favorable to
the production of ecads from adaptable species. No attempt has yet been
made to apply it to mutable or variable species, but its ultimate application
to these does not seem at all impossible. The chief advantage of the method
of habitat cultures is seen in the great range of choice in selecting the plant
for experiment, and the habitat or area in which the experiment is carried
out. A polydemic species which already has one or more ecads can be extended
to a number of different habitats of known value, and a complete
series of ecads obtained, based either upon water-content, or light, or upon
both. On the other hand, an endemic species, or one brought from a remote
flora, can be placed in as many habitats as desired, and the appearance of
ecads followed in each. Frequently, results of much value are obtained in a
diversified habitat by growing its most plastic species in those areas which
show the greatest differences in water-content or light intensity. Habitat
cultures give results which are practically as perfect as those obtained from
natural experiments, since the course of adaptation in no wise depends upon
whether the agent by which the seed or propagule is carried into the new
habitat is natural or artificial. Cultures of this kind further possess the
distinct advantage of permitting more or less modification of the physical
factors themselves. However, when it is desirable to have the factors under
as complete control as possible, it is necessary to use the method of control
cultures in the planthouse.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>192. Methods.</b> All field experiments in evolution are based upon a
change of habitat. The latter is accomplished by the modification of the
habitat itself, or by the transfer of the species to one or more different habitats,
or to different areas of the same habitat. In both cases the choice of
habitats is made upon the basis of efficient differences of water-content or
light. Saline situations do not constitute an exception, since the chresard
is really the effective stimulus. Cultures at different altitudes, which afford
striking results, appear to concern several factors, but in the final analysis,
water-content and humidity are alone found to be really formative. Cultures
may furthermore be distinguished as simple or reciprocal. Simple
cultures are those in which a species is transferred to one or more habitats,
or in which a habitat is modified in one or more ways. Reciprocal cultures
are possible only with polydemic species, or with endemics after ecads have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>been produced by experiment. Modification or transfer is made in the usual
way, but reciprocally, i. e., the original form is transferred to the habitat of
the ecad, and the latter to the habitat of the former; or the shade in which
some individuals of the ecad are growing may be destroyed, and at the same
time individuals of the type may be shaded. Both transfer and modification
may be applied to the same species, but since the same measured change of
factor can be obtained in either way, the use of both is undesirable, with the
exception of the rare cases where they serve as checks upon each other.
The transfer of a seed or plant is so much simpler and more convenient
that this method is the one regularly used. It sometimes happens, however,
that a change of water-content or light intensity is readily and conveniently
made, and is desirable for other reasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that both transfer and modification require that the factor
records of the various habitats or areas be as full as possible, at least so far
as water-content, humidity, and light are concerned. In the case of the
areas that are to be modified, these factors are determined before the change
is made. Afterward they are read from time to time during the growing
season, and are also checked by readings made near at hand in the unmodified
formation. The readings made in the beginning should correspond
closely to the check readings, but in case of disagreement the latter are to
be taken as conclusive.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>193. Transfer.</b> After the species to be used for experiment has been
chosen, the various habitats or areas selected, and the direct factors measured
by instruments, the actual transfer of the individuals is made by means
of seeds, preferably in autumn, though the results are practically the same
if seeds are kept over the winter and planted at the opening of spring. The
natural method is to scatter the seeds in the place selected, as though they
had been carried by the usual agents of migration. The mortality is usually
great in such case, however, and the chances of success are increased
by actually planting the seeds. This is the method which has been used in
making cultures of species of the European Alps on the summit of Mount
Garfield in the Rocky mountains. The number of seeds used is recorded in
order to obtain some estimate of germination and competition. While the
use of the seed or disseminule possesses the great advantage of making the
experiment essentially a natural one, the transfer of rosettes, seedlings, or
young plants makes the results more certain, and consequently saves time,
even though the actual transfer is somewhat more difficult. It is hardly
necessary to point out that the removal of the plant should be made with the
greatest care. The best success is obtained by making the transfer on cloudy
or rainy days, and when shade plants are to be placed in sunny situations,
they should be transplanted late in the afternoon. When the task of carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>them is not too great, it is a distinct advantage to move a number of
individuals in the same block of earth. The transfer of mature plants is
inadvisable, except for those perennials which can not readily be secured in
an early stage. This naturally does not apply to woody plants, evergreen
herbs, mosses and lichens; the last two may be transferred at any time with
satisfactory results. Each culture is carefully marked with stakes, and
definitely located by means of landmarks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reciprocal transfers may be made by means of seed or plant. Since the
experiment is a complex one, all the care possible should be taken to make
sure that the plants become established in the reciprocal situations, and consequently,
it is often advisable to transfer both seeds and plants. Reciprocal
transfer is of paramount value in solving the problem which bog plants
present. A slight modification of the method makes it possible to obtain
experimental evidence of the polyphyletic origin of species in consequence
of adaptation. In an experiment mentioned elsewhere, the transfer of
<em>Kuhnistera purpurea</em> to the area occupied by <em>K. candida</em>, and vice versa, is
designed to show whether one has been derived from the other. If the two
species are moved into an area which contains more water than that usually
occupied by <em>K. purpurea</em>, and less water than is found where <em>K. candida</em>
habitually grows, the resulting modifications will throw much light upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>origin of polyphyletic species. In this connection, it hardly needs to be
pointed out that this simple transfer of a species to several separated areas
of a new habitat may often furnish complete proof that a new form may
arise at different times, and at different places.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><b>194. Modification of the habitat.</b> Efficient changes in the habitat are
brought about by increasing or decreasing the water-content, or by varying
the light intensity between sunshine and the diffuse light of deep forests.
Humidity can not well be regulated except in so far as it is connected with
water-content. Since its effects merge with those of the latter, its modification
is unnecessary. An increase in water-content is readily brought about
by irrigation. A stream may be dammed and its water allowed to spread
over the area to be studied, or the water may be carried to the proper place
by deflecting the stream or
by digging a canal. The
construction of earth reservoirs
makes it possible to
obtain almost any per cent
of soil water by varying the
size of the reservoir or the
height of the wall or bank.
Near a base station, such as
Minnehaha, where there is a
simple system of water-works,
the experimental area
may be watered whenever
desirable by means of a hose.
Water-content may be readily
decreased by drainage, or
by the deflection of a stream.
When such means are not
available, as in the case of
extensive marshes, hummocks
may be used or constructed,
and the soil blocks
containing plants placed upon
them. By the use of sand or gravel, the water-content of mesophytic
areas can be reduced in a similar manner, or by surrounding the plant <em>in situ</em>
with either of these soils which hold little water. In meadows, especially,
the addition of a large quantity of alkaline salts decreases the amount of
available water, while the holard may be reduced by denuding the soil about
the plants concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>In sunny habitats, the light intensity is most easily reduced by means of
cloth awnings, which can be put in place conveniently. It is not a difficult
matter to produce effective shade by using shrubs or small trees for this purpose.
This plan is especially advantageous in habitats too remote to make
frequent visits feasible. When a shrub or tree is used, the experiment necessarily
requires a longer time, though this disadvantage is partly compensated
by the fact that
the shelter requires
practically no attention
after the shrub is once
established. Forest
plantations furnish excellent
examples of this
kind of experiment. On
the other hand, clearings
afford the only examples
of habitats modified
in such manner as
to increase the light. In
nature, the diffuse light
in which shade plants
grow is due to the presence
of tall plants,
chiefly shrubs and trees,
and an increase in the
light intensity is possible
only through the
thinning-out or removal
of the plant screen.
This is a task of considerable
magnitude in forests,
but it can be readily accomplished in thickets and at the edges of woodlands.
It is quite practicable to establish a series of awnings or clearings of
various light values, but the labor required is hardly worth while when it is
recalled that the method of transfer makes it possible to take advantage of
the various intensities already found in nature.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>METHOD OF CONTROL CULTURES</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>195. Scope and procedure.</b> Control experiments are necessarily
carried on in the planthouse, since factors can be controlled in the field
only with great difficulty. Their greatest value is in connection with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>experiments that are being carried on in the habitat, but they also
constitute an invaluable means of independent research, since it is not at
all difficult to approximate the conditions of a habitat, especially with
reference to water-content and light. The essential feature of the method
is that the less important factors are equalized as far as possible, while the
direct factors, water-content and light, are under the complete control of
the investigator. By the equalization of humidity and temperature is meant
experimentation in which all the plants of each experiment are subjected to
the same amounts of these factors. It is a matter of no importance whatever
whether the humidity and temperature are constant or variable. In
the case of soil, which is not a variable, it naturally happens that the plants
are placed once for all in the same soil mixture. Batteries consisting of
thermograph and psychrograph have been kept in the different control
houses, but although used at first to give some idea of the hourly and daily
fluctuations of temperature and humidity, they have slight bearing upon the
evolution of new forms under control. For use in connection with supplementary
experiments in adjustment and adaptation, the batteries have
proved to be indispensable. Control experiments are regularly made in
series which are planned with reference to as many modifications as the
efficient difference of the factor and the plasticity of the species concerned
permit.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>196. Water-content series.</b> An account of the experiments which
have been carried on for four generations with <em>Ranunculus sceleratus</em> will
serve to show the application of culture methods to the origin of new forms
in response to varying water-content. This species was chosen because it
grows readily in the planthouse, is plastic, and, since it is naturally amphibious,
permits of much modification in both directions. The smallest
amount of water per day under which the seedlings would grow was found
to be 25 cc. This was taken as one extreme for the series, and deep water
in which the plant could be submerged as the other. An arbitrary series
was tentatively made as follows: 25 cc., 50 cc., 100 c., 150 cc., 200 cc.,
mud, shallow water, and deep water. Further study justified these
divisions, since the first six gave efficient differences in water-content, and
the resulting forms all showed differences of structure as well as of growth
and form. Seedlings of the same age, and as nearly alike as possible, were
transplanted to large pots of which there were four for each of the first
six; they were placed in half-barrels for mud and floating forms, and in a
barrel for submerged forms. After a few days, when they had become well
established, the plants in the pots were watered in the amounts indicated, as
often as was necessary to keep the most xerophytic form alive; the soil for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the mud form was kept covered with a thin film of water; the leaves of the
form in shallow water were kept floating on the surface, and those of the
last form submerged just below the surface. The water in which the submerged
form grew was aerated by means of a spigot near the bottom of the
barrel. From time to
time water-content determinations
were made
of the soil in the pots
until it was definitely ascertained
that the holard
was practically constant.
The nine new forms obtained
by adaptation
showed striking differences
in vigor and
growth, as may be seen
from the figures. In all
cases, these were accompanied
by distinct
and often striking differences
in the number
and position of the stomata,
the amount of
sponge and palisade tissues,
and the development
of air passages.
Photographs were made
of a typical plant of
each form, and the different
leaf structures
were preserved in permanent mounts. The xerophytic and the submerged
form were unable to produce flowers, and it was necessary to develop them
anew in each generation. The other forms fruited abundantly, and the
succeeding generations of each form were produced from plants which had
grown the year before in the same conditions. In addition to the development
of a series of new water-content forms, this experiment was begun
in the hope of determining whether the modifications of a plastic species
tend to become fixed if each new form is grown constantly under the same
conditions. A period of four years is too short, however, to throw much
light upon this problem.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span><em>Helianthus annuus</em> has been used for other series of experiments, in
which alkaline salts or different soils are employed to vary the water-content.
These are more complex and hence are not as satisfactory as the series
described above, but they are valuable for the light they throw upon the
behavior of plants in similar conditions in nature. In the case of soil,
however, the adaptation may be referred to water-content alone, if
thoroughly leached sands and gravels are used, so that the difference is
solely one of water-retaining power.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>197. Light series.</b> Cloth tents have been found the most satisfactory
means of obtaining different light intensities in the planthouse. The cloth
permits the air to circulate to a considerable degree, and in consequence
the equalization of humidity and temperature is much more complete than
in the glass houses first employed. The cloth tents, or shade tents as they
are called, are cubical, each dimension being 1 meter. The series which
has been most used consists of three tents: the first is made of cheesecloth
and has a light value of .1; the second is of thin muslin, and has a
value of .04, while the third is made of dark cambric and the light is reduced
to .01. A more desirable series is one with five tents, which have approximately
the following light intensities: .1, .05, .01, .007, .003. Plants grown
in shade tents should be repotted as often as they will permit in order to
increase the aeration of the soil. The amount of water given them must
also be decreased as the shade increases. Mesophytic species give the best
results in shade tents, xerophytes thrive less well, and amphibious plants do
not grow at all except in the brightest light. Excellent results have been
obtained with <em>Helianthus</em>, <em>Taraxacum</em>, <em>Gaura</em>, and <em>Onagra</em>, while <em>Ranunculus
sceleratus</em> is unable to produce flowers and seeds in a light intensity
of .01.</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of important supplementary experiments have been made in
connection with light tents. These do not result in the production of new
forms, but they throw much light upon it. Plants have been placed in
the shade tents so that certain leaves would be in the sun and others in
the shade. Young leaves have been fixed at various angles with the
stem, and they have been revolved 90° or 180° in order to change the relation
of their surfaces. Soils of different colors, e. g., loam and sand, have
been used to determine the effect of light reflected from their surfaces.
Shade tents make it possible to illuminate plants from the top, bottom, or
side, and to carry on a large number of fundamental experiments in adjustment
and adaptation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV. THE PLANT FORMATION<br> <span class='c014'><span class='sc'>Methods of Investigation and Record</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><b>198. The need of exact methods.</b> The use of instruments in the study of
the habitat has made it evident that the loose methods of descriptive ecology
were altogether inadequate to the accurate investigation of the formation.
This feeling has been heightened by the recognition of the fact that vegetation
exhibits both development and structure, and is, in consequence, open
to exact methods of inquiry. In the search for feasible methods, it was
quickly seen that the quadrat, first<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c017'><sup>[20]</sup></a> used for determining the abundance of
species, furnished the key to the problem. Accordingly, the principle underlying
it, viz., that of intimate detailed study and record, was developed
and extended in such a way as to give rise to a number of methods of
precision. These have been applied in the field for several years with
signal success, and they are here described in the conviction that they constitute
a satisfactory system, if not, indeed, the only one for the exact study
of formations.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been a growing appreciation of the fact that the superficial
methods of descriptive ecology made it impossible to build upon such a
foundation, and they, indeed, were making actual progress in the field of
ecology more and more difficult. Ecologists have now begun to see clearly
that precise methods are as indispensable in the habitat as they are to the
study of the structure and modification of the plant. For some reason,
however, they have been slow to perceive that accuracy in the investigation
of the cause, the habitat, is a fruitless task unless it be followed by corresponding
exactness in the study of the effect, the formation. After having
urged the fundamental necessity of instrumental methods, for six or seven
years, both in season and out of season, the writer does not feel called
upon to further plead the cause of the quadrat. The final acceptance of the
instrument was inevitable if progress were to be made in the habitat, and
it is just as obvious that the quadrat must be accepted if the study of the
habitat is to bear fruit in the interpretation of the formation. The use of
the quadrat does not mean that the general methods of descriptive ecology
are all to be discarded, whether they have value or not. The statement that
quadrat methods are indispensable signifies merely that they must be used
for research work in the development and structure of vegetation. They are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>not necessary in reconnaissance, nor do they displace general methods of
real value. The use of the latter in even a supplementary way will gradually
be discontinued, however, as fields become smaller by reason of increase
in the number of workers, and as the need for precise methods
becomes more universally felt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quadrat constitutes the initial concept from which all the methods
have grown. In itself, it has given rise to a variety of quadrats applicable
to the most fundamental problems of vegetation. From it have come, on
the one hand, the migration circle, and on the other, the transect. The
latter in turn has yielded the ecotone chart, and the layer chart. All of
these are based upon direct and detailed contact with vegetation itself, and
permit accurate recording of all the results obtained.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>QUADRATS</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>199. Uses.</b> In its simplest form, the quadrat, as the name implies, is
merely a square area of varying size marked off in a formation for the purpose
of obtaining accurate information as to the number and grouping of the
plants present. As indicated above, it was first used for determining the
abundance of the various species of a formation. This made it possible to
ascertain the relative rank of the species of layers and formations, and
enabled one for the first time to gain some idea of the minute structure of
a bit of vegetation. The results were at once applied to the task of establishing
a numerical basis for abundance, and of working out a new system of
abundance to correspond. The quadrat method was also used to determine
the character of seasonal aspects, and to yield a knowledge of the exact
differences in diverse areas of the same formation. Incidentally, the determinations
of abundance were made the basis of an actual census of certain
alpine formations. This, while it was extremely interesting to find that a
square mile of alpine meadow contained approximately 1,500,000,000 plants,
was confessedly destitute of ecological value. The most important applications
of the quadrat idea were made by Clements<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c017'><sup>[21]</sup></a> in the chart, the permanent
and the denuded quadrats. The development of these was due to the
fact that zones or formations permit of comparison upon floristic as well
as physical grounds, and that a detailed record of their structure is necessary
for this purpose. Similar comparisons are necessary for the consocies,
zones, and patches of the same formation, and the quadrat becomes an indispensable
means for studying alternation and zonation. For the investigation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of invasion year by year, and especially for succession, the method
of permanent quadrats is imperative, and the denuded quadrat an invaluable
aid. Changes, which would otherwise be incompletely observed and imperfectly
recorded, are followed in the minutest detail and recorded with
perfect accuracy.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>200. Possible objections.</b> The use of the quadrat has led to the criticism
that it is needlessly detailed and thorough, and that, after all, the space
covered is but a minute part of the entire formation. The first objection is
one that has also been urged against the use of instruments of precision in
the habitat. It is always brought forward by those who have not used instruments,
and as witnesses they are of necessity incompetent. No one who
is familiar with the instrument or the quadrat by actual practice has felt
that the methods based upon them were too thorough. In no case has the
writer ever listed or mapped a quadrat without discovering some new fact
or relation, or clearing up an old question. It can not be denied that quadrat
methods require both time and patience, but this is true of any kind of research
work that is at all worth while. Every ecologist, moreover, that
has the interests of his field at heart and deprecates the present slipshod
work, will appreciate the necessity of methods which seem like drudgery
to the mere dabbler.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second objection, that the quadrat is at best but a small bit of the
area under investigation, seems at first to be a valid one. It can not be
gainsaid that the actual space studied is insignificant as compared with the
whole formation; still, it must be obvious that even a single quadrat can
add at least some facts of value, which can never be obtained by the
best of general methods. Furthermore, if the formation be an actual
and not an imaginary one, a single quadrat will be in some measure representative.
In the more homogeneous ones, it will have much the same
value that a type specimen bears to the species established upon it. In
formations which are less uniform, its value is correspondingly reduced, so
that in formations which show marked zones, consocies, or patches, it
becomes necessary to locate a quadrat in each. In the matter of representation
alone, the graphic method of the quadrat map with its close-focus detail
photograph, is far superior to anything that can be obtained by the ordinary
description and photograph. Finally, the scientific study and recording
of succession, and particularly of competition, is an impossibility without
the aid of the permanent and denuded quadrat. The stoutest champion of
the practice of walking through a formation, and jotting down impressions,
can not avoid their use if he would attack these problems, and, once familiar
with the quadrat, his objections to the drudgery of thoroughness will
soon vanish.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>
  <h4 class='c018'><em>Kinds of Quadrats and Their Use</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>201. Size and kinds.</b> The unit size of quadrat is the meter, and when
the term is used without qualification, it refers to the meter quadrat. To
make them strictly comparable, and exactly divisible, unit quadrats are
always grouped in squares; thus a major quadrat is a square of four units,
and a perquadrat one of sixteen units, or four meters square. Quadrats of
greater size are necessary in woodland and forest, where the rule, however,
is that the woody plants alone are recorded for the whole quadrat, the herbaceous
growth being listed or mapped for but one or two representative
units. For special purposes, quadrats of 3, 5, 6, etc., meters may be used,
but they are much less convenient. Quadrats are further distinguished with
respect to their use. A list quadrat is one in which the plants are merely
listed and the number of individuals of each species indicated. Chart
quadrats are those in which the area concerned is accurately mapped on
plotting paper. Both list and chart quadrats are rendered permanent by
careful labeling, so that their changes can be followed from year to year.
The greater value of the chart causes practically all permanent quadrats
to be of this type, and for the same reason only permanent chart quadrats
are converted into denuded ones.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>202. Tapes and stakes.</b> The lines for marking out quadrats are made
of strong white tape, ⅝ inches wide. This is doubled and sewed firmly
at both edges. Under moderate stretching, the tape is carefully marked
off into decimeters, and eyelets 5 mm. in diameter are set in at each end
and at the marks. This can readily be done by any shoemaker at slight expense.
The usual lengths are one and two meters, as these are most
frequently used, and they can also be easily combined to make larger
quadrats. The tapes are slightly longer than one meter in order that the
distance between the end eyelets may be exact. The tapes of the larger
forest quadrats should be divided into lengths of one meter, as these permit
ready plotting and also make it possible to interpolate a meter quadrat for
the study of the undergrowth at any point. The intervals of the tape are
numbered from left to right, as conspicuously and clearly as possible. For
this a waterproof ink or paint is very desirable. For holding the tapes in
position, hatpins, nails, and meat-skewers have been used with more or less
satisfaction. The ideal stake, however, is one which holds the tape close
to the ground, and can be readily moved. It is merely a stout wire, 3 mm.
in diameter and 8 inches long, looped at the top, sharpened at the tip, and
with a small ring of solder 3 inches from the tip.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span><b>203. Locating quadrats.</b> In staking a quadrat, the end tapes are invariably
placed so that the numbers read from left to right, and the side
tapes so that they read down. In mapping, a fifth tape is stretched parallel
to the top, and as each decimeter strip is marked, the outer tape is shifted
to delimit the new strip. Indeed, the side tapes can be placed alone, and the
plotting tapes moved down one at a time as the mapping proceeds, but it
is usually more satisfactory to locate the quadrat exactly and to square it
first, a task most easily done by enclosing the whole quadrat, and then using
a fifth tape. In the case of list quadrats in open vegetation, the measuring
strip is unnecessary, but as a rule it facilitates counting, as well as mapping.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>The List Quadrat</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>204. Description.</b> This, as the simplest form of quadrat, is employed
primarily to ascertain the abundance of species in a formation or during
a particular aspect of it. Since this can be obtained readily from the
chart, the list quadrat has fallen more and more into disuse, except where it
is desired to determine abundance alone, or to aid in deciding whether a
chart is really representative. The size depends almost wholly upon the
nature of the vegetation. When the number of trees is to be determined, a
quadrat of 10 or 50 meters is necessary. In ordinary herbaceous formations,
the usual size is 2 meters, while the meter quadrat is used when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>plants are especially small and crowded, as in alpine meadows. The location
of the quadrat is based upon the general rule, but since its especial
task is the determination of the greatest variable in vegetation, viz., number,
it is necessary to use more quadrats, and to place them in areas which show
the greatest differences in the mixture of species. For example, it was
found that a half dozen list quadrats, when carefully located in the prairie
formation, gave results almost identical with those obtainable from a larger
number. With a little experience, the various degrees of mixture can be
picked out superficially, and the corresponding number of quadrats established.
If a single list quadrat is to be made for a formation or station,
such a time should be selected as will make it possible to cover the greatest
number of plants. Fortunately, this usually falls near the middle of the
summer, when the remains of spring plants are still in evidence, and the
autumn ones are sufficiently developed to be recognizable. In taking the
census of different aspects, the quadrat should be made as near the middle
of the period as is possible.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>205. Manner of use.</b> In listing a quadrat, i. e., counting the individuals
of each species, the plan followed is to list the smaller, less conspicuous
plants first, since they are apt to be tramped down. As a rule, the outside
tapes and the taller species afford sufficient landmarks. When this is not
the case, the measure tape is used, and the individuals of all species are
checked as they are found, while in the first method one species, rarely two,
is taken at a time. In cases of peculiar difficulty, it may be permissible to
pull or break plants as they are counted, but ordinarily this can and should
be avoided. Clusters, and bunches of stems from the same root are counted
as single plants, and the number of stems indicated by an exponent. In
the case of bunch grasses, each bunch counts as one plant.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>206. Table of abundance.</b> The species are arranged in the final list
in the order of their numerical importance, and are divided into groups
which correspond to the different degrees of abundance. The latter
are arranged in two series, based upon the fact that association is by
groups or by individuals. The table of abundance, based upon a 2–meter
quadrat rather than upon the 5–meter one, by means of which the earlier
results were obtained, is as follows:</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>It is obvious that the above outline is faulty inasmuch as it takes no
account of the height and width of the individuals. This is a serious
defect, and it constitutes one of the many reasons why the list quadrat should
be replaced by the chart quadrat. The prairie formation affords an unusually
striking illustration of this. A single quadrat may be filled by ten
plants of <em>Psoralea floribunda</em>, and at the same time contain 22,000 plants of
<em>Festuca octoflora</em>. Yet the former is conspicuous and controlling, the latter
plays an altogether insignificant role. This difference is readily shown by
comparing a plant of each. The one is 3 × 3 feet, the other 3 × ¼ inch.
Such figures furnish a valuable check upon mere number, but make the
brief, graphic designation of abundance difficult. An attempt has been
made to solve this problem by roughly determining the space occupied by
the plant, by means of the formula, height (π<em>R</em><sup>2</sup>) × abundance. This
would give <em>Psoralea</em> a value of 210, and <em>Festuca</em> one of 1.6, which much
more nearly represents their real importance in the formation. Abundance
or numerical value is a floristic concept entirely, and has little place in
ecology unless checked in the way indicated. The whole problem, ecologically,
depends upon an intimate knowledge of competition, and its solution
in consequence is at present impossible.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>The Chart Quadrat</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>207. Description and use.</b> The detailed labor required in mapping makes
it advisable to use the meter quadrat. An additional reason of much importance
is furnished by the desirability of securing a detail photograph of the
quadrat. This is impossible with field cameras, which should not exceed
6½ x 8½ inches, and are indeed most serviceable in the 4 × 5 size, if the
area be larger. In open formations, the major quadrat of 2 meters can be
used if necessary, but this is very rarely the case. Forest quadrats of ten
meters square are easily charted, but detail photographs can not be made of
them. Larger quadrats are impracticable; they can be counted but not
mapped to advantage. The location of the chart quadrat must be decided
by the structure to be studied. Its greatest service is in connection with
zones and societies of the same formation, which can be easily compared
in the chart form. In fact, the chart quadrat may well be regarded
as the fundamental method for inquiry into zonation and alternation. It is
an important aid in delimiting areas from the contiguous formations, and in
determining the relationships of mixed formations. It is also used to record
the character of the different aspects, but this is done more satisfactorily by
the permanent quadrat.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span><b>208. The chart</b> used is a decimeter square, and the scale is consequently
10 : 1. It is outlined on centimeter plotting paper, and the centimeter squares
are numbered at the edges to correspond to the intervals of the quadrat, i. e.,
the top and bottom lines are numbered from left to right, and the side lines
from top to bottom. These outlines are ruled in quantity and used as needed,
or the forms can be furnished by the printer. In practice, a special quadrat
book the size of the chart has been used. The need of a second book may be
avoided by outlining two charts on the plotting sheet, and filing the latter in
the field record book. In the few cases where 2–meter quadrats are desirable,
four charts are used, care being taken to label them so that they can be
combined whenever necessary. Ten-meter quadrats are recorded on the decimeter
chart also, each meter interval corresponding to a centimeter, i. e., the
scale is 100 : 1.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>209. Mapping</b> is invariably begun at the upper left-hand corner of the
chart, and is carried across the strip marked off by the plotting tape, decimeter
by decimeter. As soon as this strip is completed, a second one is
formed by moving the top tape to a position one decimeter below the plotting
tape, which then becomes the upper one. This is repeated until the last strip
is reached. Little difficulty is experienced in locating each plant exactly, as
the decimeter interval is small, and the centimeter square which corresponds
is divided into twenty-five tiny squares. Each plant is put in whenever possible,
but mats, turfs, and mosses are merely outlined in mass if the individuals
are not distinguishable. This holds true of all large rosettes and mats,
even when they are single plants. Symbols were formerly used for indicating
the various species. They have the advantage of requiring little space
on the chart, and the disadvantage of necessitating constant reference to the
legend. They are at present replaced by initials. By this plan, the decapitalized
first letter of the generic name is used if no other genus found in the
quadrat begins with the same letter. If, however, two or more genera begin
with <em>a</em>, for example <em>Agropyrum</em>, <em>Anemone</em>, and <em>Allium</em>, the most abundant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>one is indicated by <em>a</em>, and the others by the first two letters, as <em>an</em>, <em>al</em>. In
case two species of the same genus are present, the species initial is used in
connection with that for the genus, as <em>ac</em> and <em>ar</em> for <em>Agropyrum caninum</em> and
<em>Agropyrum richardsonii</em> respectively. It is rarely necessary to exceed two
letters for any species. Plants which regularly have several stems from the
same root are indicated by the initial and an exponent as <em>a</em><sup>3</sup>. Seedlings are
represented by a line drawn through the letter. Usually the chart sheet
affords sufficient space below the chart for the legend. When the list of
species is long, the back of the sheet is used.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>210. Factors and photographs.</b> Each chart is numbered, and the formation,
station, and date indicated. The constant factors, altitude, slope, and
exposure are ascertained and recorded on the sheet. The variable factors
are read in each quadrat whenever possible, and in addition to being preserved
in the record book, are noted on the chart sheet along with the base
reading in the formation for the same time. This facilitates the interpretation
of the differences found when two or more charts are compared. Chart
quadrats are regularly photographed. For this purpose a long focus 4 × 5
camera with a telephoto lens is used. At the proper distance this will make
a view of the same size as the chart, thus making possible an exact comparison
of the two. The chart and photograph serve as mutual checks, as well
as complements, since the former shows number, position, and arrangement,
and the latter, height, form, position, and arrangement. The view is usually
made by placing the camera directly in front of the middle of the lower tape,
at such a distance that the side tapes fall just within the limits of the ground
glass. The swing is always used in order that the focus may be uniformly
sharp. Surface views of the quadrat can be taken by means of a device
which permits the camera to hang downward from the tripod, or by means
of a tripod with a swinging platform. Such views are especially valuable
for the study of competition, since they give a clear idea of the spread and
density of the various plants. They are difficult to make unless the vegetation
is low and nearly uniform in height. The usual photograph is much
more serviceable in regular quadrat work.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>The Permanent Quadrat</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>211. Description and uses.</b> As stated heretofore, either list or chart quadrats
may be rendered permanent in order that they may be followed from
season to season or from year to year. As a matter of fact, however, an area
which is to be studied repeatedly really demands charting, and in practice
chart quadrats alone are made permanent. This is done simply by driving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>a labeled stake at one corner of the quadrat, and locating the latter definitely
in relation to a conspicuous landmark. When one is in residence for several
years, practically all chart quadrats are converted into permanent ones, since
the work already done in the chart quadrat is so much accomplished towards
the permanent one. This is not necessary when one wishes merely to compare
different areas of stable formations. As a rule, however, some change
is constantly being wrought by invasion or competition, and the amount and
direction of this can only be revealed by the permanent quadrat. The latter
has a fundamental value for all kinds of invasion, but it is absolutely indispensable
in studying complete invasion or succession, and in discovering and
recording the gradual effects of competition. It is in the detailed investigation
of these dynamic phenomena that the paramount importance of the
quadrat is most evident. If the experience of several years be taken as conclusive,
no other method is capable of revealing the minute changes as they
are occurring.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The permanent quadrat is regularly 1 meter square, a size determined both
by the exigencies of charting and photographing. When ecograph batteries
are used, the quadrat is located as close to the latter as is possible. Otherwise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the quadrat itself should constitute a station for making factor observations.
This connection is absolutely essential, since the quadrat is used
expressly to determine the structural changes, which are produced by physical
factors, and the reaction of vegetation upon them. Permanent quadrats
are established in different formations or stages of a succession to trace the
invasion of new species and the dropping out of old ones in response to competition.
They serve to distinguish the proper formation, which represents
a particular stage of development, from the mixed formations which precede
and follow, and also to determine the exact course as well as the rapidity of
the change that follows each reaction. When applied to different examples
of the same stage, and to all the different stages of a succession, the whole
development of the latter may be minutely traced and definitely recorded.
The importance of following the changes from aspect to aspect is much less,
since these are periodical rather than dynamic. They are an essential feature
of structure, however, and it has been the practice to make at least one series
of aspect charts from each permanent quadrat.</p>

<p class='c007'>For tracing the invasion and competition of lichens and mosses, which play
a primary role in initial formations, a subquadrat is used. The size varies,
but it is usually smaller than the quadrat, although the latter is entirely available
in the case of the large foliose lichens. For the crustose and smaller
foliose forms, a subquadrat 2 decimeters square is used, and for the larger
forms and tufted mosses, one of 5 decimeters. In the case of ground forms,
tapes are employed, and the quadrat is permanently staked. On rocks and
cliffs, where moss and lichen stages are most common, tapes are impracticable,
and the quadrat is permanently outlined with paint. Charts of lichen quadrats
are made to the usual scale of 10 : 1.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>212. Manner of use.</b> Permanent quadrats are mapped and photographed
in exactly the same way as chart quadrats. As soon as this has been done, a
labeled stake is driven at the upper left-hand corner, so that its edge indicates
the exact position of the quadrat stake, and a smaller one is placed at the opposite
corner to facilitate the task of setting the tapes accurately in later
readings. The label stake bears merely the number of the quadrat and the
date when it was first established. It is firmly fixed and allowed to project
just enough to enable it to be located readily. Its position requires careful
landmarking when the quadrat is to be visited year by year. In forest formations,
this is readily done by blazing, but in grassland it is necessary to
have recourse to compass and pacing, or to erect an artificial landmark.
After several charts have been made, a permanent quadrat attains a high
value, and every precaution must be taken to prevent losing its exact location.
At the second reading of a quadrat, whether in the succeeding aspect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>or year, the tapes are placed with reference to the stakes, and a chart and
photograph are made in the usual manner. These are labeled and dated like
the original ones, but they are numbered to indicate both the quadrat and the
series, e. g., 15<sup>2</sup> indicates the second chart, and photograph made of quadrat
15. The date indicates whether the readings are by the aspect or the year,
though this may be shown also in the name of the series itself. It is clearly
an advantage to have the two successive charts of a quadrat upon the same
sheet, and to file all the charts and photographs of the same permanent quadrat
together, and in the proper order.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since much of the value of a permanent quadrat depends upon its use as a
station for observing physical factors, it is unprofitable to establish a large
number. The results of invasion and competition can be ascertained by the
quadrat alone, but these should be merely preliminary to seeking for their
causes. Clearly, a quadrat should be established for each battery of instruments,
while additional ones should be located only in so far as they can be
visited often enough to give an insight into the factors that control them.
In view of the fact that the most important factors, water-content and light,
are less variable than humidity, temperature, and wind, it will suffice if visits
are made once a week. This is especially true when it is possible to refer
the more variable factors to the continuous records of a base station. While
all the results determined for permanent quadrats are preserved in the field
record, a record of them is also kept on the reverse of the chart sheet for
convenience in interpreting the different charts.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>The Denuded Quadrat</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>213. Description.</b> This is primarily a permanent quadrat from which the
plant covering has been removed, after it has been charted and photographed.
What is practically the same thing is obtained by establishing a permanent
quadrat in a new soil, or in one recently laid bare and not yet reclothed with
plants. These, however, are merely permanent quadrats, in which the first
chart and photograph furnish a record of the habitat alone. They are of
great importance in succession, and will be more fully discussed under experimental
vegetation. The denuded quadrat is of the usual size, 1 meter,
though the smaller lichen quadrats are also denuded. The location is subject
to the conditions already indicated, especially with reference to physical
factors. The denuded quadrat, however, is particularly adapted to the study
of invasion and the resulting competition. Consequently, when migration is
markedly from one direction, a series of denuded quadrats throws a flood of
light upon the actual steps in invasion. Denuding is a valuable aid in succession,
but it must be clearly recognized that, while permanent quadrats
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>register the exact course of the succession, denuded ones can merely furnish
facts as to the probable courses of stages not now in evidence.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig_54.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 54. Denuded quadrat; this is the quadrat shown in figure 53; photographed September 7, 1904.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>214. Methods of denuding and recording.</b> Permanent quadrats may be
denuded at any time during the time they are under observation. The best
results, however, are to be obtained by establishing the two side by side, or at
least close together. In this way, they are mutually supplementary, and furnish
the most evidence possible with regard to the procedure of invasion and
competition. Another advantage is found in that the same observations of
climatic factors will do for both, though water-content and soil temperatures
are necessarily different. A quadrat which is to be denuded is first mapped,
photographed, and labeled exactly like a permanent quadrat. The vegetation
is then destroyed. This is usually done by removal, though it may also
be burnt, destroyed by flooding, or in some other manner. The method will
depend upon the use which the quadrat is to serve. If it is to throw light
upon the vegetation of an area in which denudation has affected the surface
alone, the aerial parts only are removed by paring the surface with a spade.
When the disturbance is to be more profound, the upper seed-bearing layer
is removed, and the underground parts dug up. In the interpretation of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>secondary succession, the denuding cause is made use of in a fashion as
nearly natural as possible. Ordinarily, the plants are removed just below
the top of the ground by a spade, leaving the underground parts undisturbed.
This method has yielded very interesting results.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quadrats have been denuded in the fall after the majority of the plants
have completed their growth. This is largely owing to the fact that other
field work is less pressing at this time. Denudation can be done as well in
the spring, though the invasion will be slower in this case, since the seeds
which have accumulated will be partly or entirely removed. During the first
season the denuded quadrat should be mapped every month, and, if the invasion
be rapid, photographed also. In open formations, especially those of
a xerophytic nature, a single chart and photograph made at the end of the
season are sufficient. In a few cases of this sort, indeed, no invaders have
appeared until the second year. Beginning with the second season, a single
record taken near the close of the growing period will suffice. Denuded
quadrats are labeled, dated, and filed exactly as other permanent quadrats,
but it should be noted that the first member of the chart and photograph
series is that which records the original vegetation of the area denuded.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>215. Physical factors.</b> When denuded quadrats are single, their physical
factors must be observed in the usual way. If they are associated with permanent
ones, the ordinary readings are made for the latter, and those factors
which are affected by exposing the soil are alone taken for the denuded area.
These are the water-content, soil and surface temperatures, and in some stations
at least the humidity near the surface. As everywhere, water-content
is the most important, but the temperature at or near the surface has a
marked effect upon germination. Because of its bearing upon the latter, the
surface water-content is usually determined also. This has been done by
taking a surface sample 2 inches square and 1 inch deep. Denuded quadrats
naturally show considerable differences from year to year as the action of the
invaders becomes more pronounced. To this fact is due much of their value
as aids in interpreting succession.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Aquatic Quadrats</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>216. Scope.</b> The preceding discussion of quadrat methods is based wholly
upon their use in terrestrial formations. Wet meadow and dry bog are the
wettest places in which quadrats have been used. It is clear, however, that
with certain necessary modifications, quadrats can be used as successfully,
though not as conveniently, in many water formations as in land ones. The
tapes need to be raised above the surface of the water by longer stakes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>photographs often taken from a boat, but otherwise the usual methods apply,
at any rate for bogs and shallow bodies of water. In lakes or streams the
tapes might be attached to buoys or floats. The determination of factors is
made as usual. Permanent quadrats are feasible in many cases at least, and
denuded quadrats are not altogether impossible.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>TRANSECTS</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>217. The transect</b> is essentially a cross section through the vegetation of a
station, a formation, or a series of formations. It is designed primarily to
show the order of arrangement of species in zones and societies, but it also
serves as a record of the heterogeneity of any area. In the form of the layer
transect, it furnishes a graphic method of representing the spatial relations
of the species in layered formations, e. g., forests, ponds, and lakes. It is
merely a logical extension of the idea underlying the quadrat, and the transect
is, indeed, little more than an elongated quadrat. An important difference,
however, lies in the fact that the former normally traverses areas more
or less unlike, while the latter is always located in a homogeneous one. Furthermore,
the transect is plotted with especial reference to the topography.
With respect to dimension, transects are classified as line, layer, and belt
transects, and the latter may also be permanent or denuded.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>The Line Transect</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>218. Description and method.</b> A simple transect is sometimes made by
establishing the points between which it is to be run, and then recording the
plants pace by pace along this line. This is satisfactory where the striking
changes in structure are desired. A more accurate method is ordinarily used,
since it gives detailed results, and at the same time brings out the more general
features. For this, use is made of a tape of proper length which is
divided into decimeters. Tapes of 10, 50, and 100 meters are used, and if
they are furnished with eyelets, transects of intermediate lengths may be run
with them. When longer transects are desired, as in the case of forest formations,
tapes of 500 or 1,000 meters should be used with eyelets a meter
apart. The transect is located in the area to be studied by running the tape
from one landmark to another, fastening it here and there by means of quadrat
stakes. Previous to this, the shortest distance between landmarks is ascertained
when the transect runs through a depression or upon a level surface.
In the case of an elevation, the height is ascertained by a barometer, the
length and angle of the two slopes obtained, and the length of the base line
determined from these data. The field record of the arrangement of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>plants is made entirely without reference
to the surface line. The vertical lines on
the centimeter sheet are taken to correspond
with the tape, and the individual
which touches the latter on either side is
recorded to the right or left respectively
and within the proper square. The species
are indicated as for quadrats. A
single row on either side may be taken
alone, but the double series serves as a
desirable check. After the record is
made, the topography of the transect is
drawn carefully to scale. This drawing
is made upon the scale of 100 : 1 for
transects of 10 meters or less, and of
1000 : 1 for those that are longer. The
combination of this drawing with the line
series of plants can not be made advantageously
in the field. For the shorter
transects, meter sizes of centimeter plotting
paper can often be used to advantage.
In this event, the topographic line
is drawn to the scale of 10 : 1 and the
series of plants transferred directly to it.
In the case of transects between 10 and
100 meters, the scale of the drawing is
increased from 1000 : 1 to 100 : 1, so that
each decimeter of the original series is
compressed into a centimeter. For the
longest transects, corresponding reductions
must be made, but in these it will
be remembered that the series is plotted
by meter instead of decimeter.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><b>219. The location and size</b> of line
transects are determined by the purpose
for which they are designed. Short
transects are valuable for detail, but they
can be used to advantage only where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>changes in arrangement are taking place rapidly. They are especially
adapted to the study of minute alternations and to the zonation of small
ponds, streams, ditches, roads, blowouts, etc. Longer transects can not furnish
the same detail, on account of the amount of time necessary, but they
are invaluable for the zonation and alternation of larger areas, such as the
consocies, formation, and formation series. They are of particular importance
for the record of zonation, since they afford a clue to the topographic
symmetry of the area. The location of a transect depends upon the area to
be studied, though it should always run through a portion as typical as possible.
The general direction is ascertained by means of the compass, and
when there is a measurable difference in elevation it is taken by the barometer
or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The points at which ecotones cross the transect are carefully indicated
upon the chart. They serve as stations for simultaneous readings of physical
factors, though in the majority of cases water-content readings alone will
determine the reason for the ecotone. Photographs of line transects should
be made while the tape is in position, in order that the superficies of the series
may be as evident as possible.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>The Belt Transect</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>220. Details.</b> This differs from the line transect in that it is wider, and
consequently affords a more accurate record of the arrangement of plants.
While both give the actual facts of distribution, the line transect necessarily
ignores the minor lateral deviations in position. These are brought out in a
strip of some width, and the belt transect thus gives a more correct view of
the variations which result from competition in an area physically homogeneous.
The width of such transects depends upon the length, and the
character of the vegetation. The standard width is one decimeter in herbaceous
formations, and one meter in the long transects which are used in
woodlands. In open vegetation, especially in the initial stages of successions,
the width may often be increased to advantage, but ordinarily the
amount of work necessary to run a belt transect of some length limits the
width to one decimeter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The location of a belt transect, the choice of landmarks, the determination
of direction and elevation are made exactly as for the line transect. The
topographic map is made in precisely the same way also, the scale used depending
upon the length. Two tapes, however, are employed, and these are
placed so that they mark off a strip just one decimeter wide. Every few
meters, or oftener if need be, they are checked by a decimeter rule, and fixed
firmly in place by quadrat stakes. The arrangement of the plants is recorded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>as for the line transect, except that the record covers a decimeter strip just
as in quadrat work. Accordingly, an interval of a centimeter is left on the
sheet between the successive portions of the strip, in order that the latter
may be put together without confusion when the topographic map and the
plant series are combined. The record should invariably start in the upper
left-hand corner and read down. The map and the centimeter strip recording
the plants of the transect are combined on a common scale as already
indicated for the line transect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ecotones of zones are shown on belt transects by single cross lines,
and those of consocies by parallel cross lines. In taking photographs of the
transect, it is desirable to use guidons to mark these points clearly. The
same device may also be used to indicate the course of the transect, when the
tapes are completely hidden by the plants. Physical factor readings should
always be taken, and, as before, they are best made at the intersections of the
ecotones.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>The Permanent Transect</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>221. Advantages.</b> Both line and belt transects, after they have been recorded,
should be rendered permanent, in order that they may serve to indicate
the changes of a heterogeneous area from year to year in the same
detailed fashion that the permanent quadrat does for homogeneous ones.
For historical as well as for physical reasons, the ecotones of zones and of
consocies are subject to change from year to year, and the amount and direction
of this change can only be ascertained from annual records made in
exactly the same spot. By means of the permanent transect alone the very
origin of such areas can be followed from one stage to another of the succession.
Moreover, the transect is equally valuable with the quadrat in
making it possible to follow every step of the minute changes wrought by
competition.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>222. Details.</b> The transect is made permanent by blazing the landmarks
at either end, if these already exist, or by erecting them when it is necessary.
A label stake is driven at each end, on which is painted the number and date
of the transect and its length. Each stake should also indicate the exact direction
in which the other lies. The position of the ecotone is indicated by
smaller stakes bearing the number of the transect and the date when the
ecotone was found at that point. These are left in place, and in a few years
show very graphically the change in position of the zones. For the first
season, permanent transects afford results of great value when recorded for
each aspect, but after this an annual visit will suffice. The details of mapping,
plotting, etc., are identical with those indicated above, with the addition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>that all charts and photographs must bear the number of the reading as well
as that of the transect. Physical factor observations are taken as often as
the charts are made, and the results noted on the back of the chart sheet for
purposes of ready comparison.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>The Denuded Transect</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>223.</b> The denuded transect bears exactly the same relation to a permanent
one as that which exists between the denuded and the permanent quadrat.
While the permanent transect records the actual mutations due to
changing physical factors or to competition, the denuded transect throws
needed light upon the mobility and ecesis of the various species, and upon
the nature of the competition between them. Denuded transects may be
established wherever it seems desirable, after the strip has been properly
charted and photographed. The most valuable results, however, are secured
by locating each one alongside of a permanent one. The best plan is to locate
and chart two permanent transects a meter apart. A single view is then
made of the two. One of them is denuded together with a strip 2 decimeters
on either side, resulting in a denuded transect 5 decimeters wide. In charting
this during succeeding years, the entire width may well be plotted as
long as the vegetation is open, but after it has again become well established,
it is necessary to save time by confining one’s attention to the central decimeter
strip. Photographs can be made either of the permanent and denuded
transects singly, or of the two together. The latter method has certain obvious
advantages. Climatic factor readings can be made for both transects
in common, but all those factors which are affected by the exposure of the
soil surface must be observed in each.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>The Layer Transect</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>224.</b> This is a modification of the line transect, by means of which the
vertical relations of plants are also shown, especially the tendency to form
layers which is so regular a feature of forest formations. Owing to the difficulty
of charting in three planes, belt transects do not lend themselves to
this purpose. Because of the greater complexity, layer transects can rarely
exceed ten meters in length except in those formations where layering is little
or not at all developed. The simplest method is to establish a line transect
in the ordinary way, and then to record the height of each plant as its
position is noted. This is done by means of a measuring stick ruled in decimeters,
which can be moved from interval to interval along the tape, or better,
by two such sticks connected by tapes a meter long at every five decimeters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>of the sticks. These should be two meters high for woodland, and
one meter for grassland. Layer transects often run on even surfaces, but if
this is not the case, the usual data for a topographic map should be taken.
The final chart is constructed on the scale of 10:1, the height of each plant
being indicated by a vertical line equal to .1 of the observed height. A photograph
of a representative meter of the transect is taken when the measuring
sticks and rods indicated above are in position. Physical factor readings,
principally of light, but often also of humidity, temperature, and wind
are made at the height of the various layers when these are present.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ECOTONE CHARTS</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>225.</b> The contour lines of zones and consocies are of the utmost importance
in recording the structure of vegetation. They do not permit such
accuracy as do quadrats and transects, but this is hardly to be considered a
disadvantage in view of the fact that ecotones are rarely sharply defined.
In establishing the ecotones of zonation, the width and the length of the
base, i. e., the area of excess or deficiency, or as much of it as is to be considered,
are determined. This base may be road, ditch, pool, lake, or stream,
or the peak or crest of a hill, ridge, or mountain. When the zonation is
bilateral, meter tapes are run at right angles to the base, at proper intervals,
and the points and the distances where the ecotones cross are noted. In the
case of radial zones, the tapes are run in the four cardinal directions, and
if the base be large, in the four intermediate ones also, the intersections
being likewise noted. From the data thus obtained, the zones may be outlined
with a fair degree of accuracy. If the series be an extensive one, it is
charted to the scale of 100:1; in cases of small areas, however, the scale of
10:1 will give better results. Whenever the zones show clearly enough to
warrant, a photograph is also taken. Water-content readings are of paramount
importance in the interpretation of zones. Samples should be taken
at all intersections, and the resulting values indicated at the corresponding
points upon the chart. When the zones are broken up into alternating
patches in consequence of asymmetry in the topography, the ecotones of the
latter are traced in a similar fashion from the center of each as a base,
the absolute position of which is ultimately determined with reference to
the ecotone lines already established.</p>

  <h3 class='c015'>THE MIGRATION CIRCLE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>226. Purpose.</b> The migration circle is designed to record the invasion
of species, since it operates outward from an individual or a group of plants
as a center. As migration takes place to a certain degree in all directions,
a circle is better adapted to the purpose than the quadrat. From the very
nature of invasion, migration circles should always he permanent in order
that the yearly advance may be accurately noted. Circles of this character
are important aids in the study of any vegetation, except, perhaps, one that
has practically become stabilized. Their great value, however, is found
in succession, where it is necessary to trace the movement of new individuals
away from the original invaders as centers of colonization.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>227. Location and method.</b> The size of the migration circle is largely
controlled by the density of the vegetation, and in some degree by the height
of the species also, since this determines the trajectory of the disseminule.
In close formations, a circle of 1–, rarely of 5–meter radius can best be used,
but in the more open initial stages of succession a radius of 5, 10, or, in exceptional
cases such as open woodland, even 25 meters, affords the best
results. The location should always be made with a plant or group of
plants of the species to be studied as a center. This migration circle differs
from the quadrat in that it is used to show the movement of one, rarely
two or three species, and not the position of all the plants within it. The
center is permanently fixed by driving a labeled stake with the number of
the circle and the data. Two tapes the length of the radius are used for
recording. These are provided with the usual eyelets, 5 decimeters apart,
and are fastened on a peg in the top of the central stake so that they move
readily. At the outer ends they are staked 5 decimeters apart by a tape of
this length when the radius is 1 meter, and 1 meter when the radius is 5 or
10 meters. The record forms must be especially prepared on blank sheets
about 9 inches square. The scale is 10:1 for circles of 1 meter, and 100:1
for those of 5– and 10–meter radius. In the former, concentric circles are
drawn about the center at intervals of 5 decimeters, and radii are drawn
to the circumference at the same interval. In the larger circles, the intervals
are 1 meter. Each segment of the circle is read by means of the two
tapes, and the position indicated with reference to the concentric lines and
radii. When but one species is read, a tiny circle is used to denote the position
of each plant. If more than one is used, the symbols are those already
indicated for the quadrat. One tape is left in place and the other with the
segment tape is shifted to a new position, and the resulting segment is read
as before. The exact position of the base radius is fixed by a label stake,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>in order that the segments of successive years may exactly correspond.
The record sheet is labeled, dated, and filed. By folding at one edge, it may
be filed in the regular field book.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>228. The denuded circle</b> is established in the same way as a permanent
one. The original position of the individuals of the species under consideration
may be recorded or not, depending upon the use to be made of the
results. The safest plan is first to read the circle in the usual way, and
then to denude it. The latter should be done in such a way as to remove
all the disseminules from the surface in so far as possible. It is essential
also that this be done before the seeds are mature and begin to be scattered.
The central plant or cluster is of course not removed. In special cases, all
the plants of the species are allowed to remain to serve as centers of colonization.
The successive yearly readings of the denuded area are made exactly
as for a permanent circle. Permanent and denuded circles, like quadrats,
should always be established near each other so that they permit of ready
comparison under similar conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>229. Photographs</b> of migration circles furnish the most detail when
the camera is placed just behind the central group in such a way as to show
its relation to the other individuals or clusters of the circle. In the denuded
circle, or when the plants stand out conspicuously from the bulk of the
vegetation, it is not necessary to use guidons, but in other cases the latter
greatly increase the value of the picture. Factor readings are less important
for migration circles than for quadrats and transects. The factors
of principal importance are those that deal with migration and ecesis, i. e.,
wind, water-content, and soil temperatures. The former may be determined
for both circles in common, but the conditions that affect ecesis must be
observed separately for each.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>CARTOGRAPHY</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>230. Value of cartographic methods.</b> Chart, map, and photograph are
records indispensable to the systematic study of vegetation. They serve
not merely to preserve the facts ascertained, and to permit their ready comparison,
but they also put a premium upon accurate methods, and consequently
bring to light many points otherwise overlooked. For ecology,
they have the value which drawings possess in taxonomy, in that they
make clear at a glance what pages of description fail to indicate. They
are the fundamental material of comparative phytogeography, and in all
careful vegetational study their use is no longer optional but obligatory.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Hence it is obvious that cartographic methods should be clear and simple,
and that they should be uniform, so that charts and maps of widely separated
formations may be directly compared without difficulty. It is not to be expected
that uniform methods will come into general use immediately, but
a proper appreciation of the obligation that rests upon every ecologist to
make his results both easily comprehensible and usable will serve to produce
this very necessary result. In the treatment that follows, as elsewhere, no
attempt is made to describe the general cartographic methods used by other
ecologists, notably Flahault. The methods employed by the author form a
complete system, which has proved valuable, and for various reasons it
alone is discussed here.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>231. Standard scale.</b> The question of the scale to which charts and
maps are to be made is of primary importance. The general principle is
that the ratio between area and drawing should be as small as possible.
Moreover, charts and maps of the same character should always be drawn
to the same scale, unless a good reason to the contrary exists. The ideal
scale is 1:1, which is manifestly an impossibility. This is approached most
nearly in the quadrat chart where the scale is 10:1. Charts of definite
areas are made on a scale as large as possible, while maps of formations,
regions, etc., are necessarily drawn upon a very small scale. General maps
designed to show the distribution of species and formations, or the vegetation
of continents, are usually not drawn with reference to a scale at all.
While it is manifestly impossible to use the same scale for charts and maps,
it is feasible and desirable that they be constructed upon scales readily convertible
into each other. This is most satisfactorily accomplished by means
of the decimal system, and the various type scales are 10:1, 100:1, 1000:1,
etc. The first two or three scales are used for charts of quadrats, transects,
and circles; the remaining ones are employed in making maps of large areas.
No attempt has been made to draw an absolute line between charts and
maps, but an endeavor is made to restrict the term chart to the record of
the number and position of plants, while maps deal with the arrangement
and location of formational areas. It is hardly necessary to point out the
reasons why all charts and maps should be based upon the decimal system of
scales. Experience will furnish the very best of arguments.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>232. Color scheme.</b> The first requisite for the graphic representation
of formations, regions, etc., is that each class of formations be invariably
indicated by the same color. It is also necessary that the colors and shades
be easily distinguishable, and it is at least desirable that they be referred to
the different classes in some consistent sequence. Uniformity in all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>points is greatly to be desired at the hands of all ecologists. Here, as in
the case of the standard scale, uniformity will be found the more desirable
the more impossible it is made by ignoring it. In the use of color to represent
regions and provinces, on maps too small to indicate formations, the
color of each division is represented by the color of its dominant formation;
thus the prairie province is colored ochroleucus on account of the
color used to represent prairie formations, the boreal-subalpine zone
atrovirens on account of the typical coniferous forests, etc. No endeavor
has been made to take account of the various types of formations, e. g., the
different coniferous forests, as this is a problem to be worked out for more
local maps in various shades of dark green, etc. The following color scheme
which has been based upon the points made above is proposed as a satisfactory
solution of the problem. The color standard used is that of
Saccardo’s Chromotaxia.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>233. Formation and vegetation maps</b> are detailed maps of a single
formation or a series of them, showing the formational limits, and when
the scale is not too small, the ecotones of zones and consocies. In the cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>where the topography is level, as sometimes happens in mapping single
formations, the chain and pedometer must be used to ascertain the size of
the different areas. Indeed in all mapping of vegetation, the methods of
surveying are directly applicable. Over large areas, however, it is not necessary
that limits be drawn with mathematical accuracy, and for the purposes
of the ecologist, the plane table and camera are satisfactory substitutes for
the surveyor’s transit, at least in the present aspect of the subject. When
the formation or group of formations is commanded by an elevation of some
height, the latter is used as a base. A plane table is established upon it and
the topographical and vegetational features are recorded in the usual way.
This map is usually supplemented by a series of views from the same base.
Indeed it has come to be recognized that a complete series of photographs
of this kind give a more valuable record than the plane table, and that the
construction of an accurate map from them is an easy matter. Since the
camera saves much time and energy also, it is used almost exclusively to
furnish the data for map making. In hilly, and especially in mountainous
regions, the photographic method is indispensable. Its application is extremely
simple. A central hill or mountain is selected, and from it a series
of views is taken so that the edge of one exactly meets the edge of the other.
This is an extremely important matter, and demands much nicety of judgment.
The camera is kept in the same spot, and after each exposure it is
turned as the operator looks through it until a landmark at one edge just
passes from view at the other. As soon as the new position is determined,
the tripod screw is turned to hold the box firmly in position. In case of a
slight jar, the exact position should again be obtained. If the series is
accurately made, the resulting prints will give a complete panoramic view
of the region, without overlap or omission. For this purpose, a 6½ × 8½
camera is desirable, since the topographic and vegetational features are
larger and stand out more distinctly. A large camera requires fewer changes
of position, and hence saves time and reduces the chance of error. A
4 × 5 camera serves the purpose sufficiently well, though it requires a little
more care in operation on account of the greater number of exposures necessary.
This may be avoided in some degree by the use of a wide-angle lens
if the depth of the area is not too great. Whatever camera may be used, a
telephoto lens is a very desirable adjunct, since it enables one to choose between
three different sizes of the view without changing the position of the
camera. To avoid possible confusion, the exposures are always made from
right to left, and the plates are used in the numerical order of their holders.
For the same reason the landmarks are described and numbered in their
proper order. The prints obtained are mounted on a card in sequence.
The view map may be preserved in this form, or it may be reduced or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>enlarged by making a copy to the size desired. Outline maps of
topography may be traced from the resulting negative, and the formations
filled in by means of the proper colors. The most satisfactory method,
however, is to have the original views or the copy printed “light” and to
color the formations just as they appear there, with all the wealth of topographic
and vegetational detail. If a detailed topographic map alone is
desired, this is traced directly from the large copy.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>234. Continental maps.</b> A method of determining the general outlines
of regions, provinces, and vegetational zones as a preliminary to their
detailed study has been used successfully for several years.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c017'><sup>[22]</sup></a> This is based
upon provincial and continental maps on which are traced the geographical
areas of the species of genera typical of the various formations. Detail
topographic maps of the prairie province and the North American continent
have been used for this purpose. A number of the facies of extensive and
representative formations of the different portions of the continent are
selected and grouped according to genera. One map is devoted to each
genus, unless the number of species is large. In this case a number of maps
are used, since the limits are apt to become confused. The range of each
species is determined from all the reliable sources, and a corresponding line
is drawn upon the map to delimit its geographical area. The limits of the
area of each species are drawn in a different color, and the name of the species
printed in the same color in the legend. Although this work has as yet been
done only for the trees of North America, and for the grasses and principal
species of the prairie province, it promises to constitute a final method for the
limitation of vegetational divisions. It is clear that if the original data
concerning ranges are accurate, the increasing study of formations will do
little more than rectify the detailed course of the limiting line, since in most
cases facies and formations coincide in distribution. The limiting line or
ecotone of a zone or province is a composite obtained from the limits of
certain representative facies and principal species, and checked by the limits
of species typical of the contiguous vegetations. Thus, the boreal-subalpine
zone is clearly outlined by combining the limits of <em>Populus tremuloides</em>,
<em>Larix americana</em>, <em>Pinus banksiana</em>, <em>Abies balsamea</em>, <em>Picea mariana</em>, <em>Picea
canadensis</em>, and <em>Betula papyracea</em>, and checking the results by the areal limits
of the hardwoods and grasses to the southward.</p>

  <h3 class='c015'>PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>235.</b> The camera is an indispensable instrument for the ecologist. Although
it has too often been employed to give an air of thoroughness to
work of no ecological value, it is as important for recording the structure
of vegetation as the automatic instrument is for the study of the habitat.
No ecologist is equipped for systematic field investigation until he is provided
with a good camera and has become skilful in its use. For this reason,
it is felt that a few hints concerning photographic methods and their application
in ecology may not be out of place. No written advice can take the
place of experience, but certain elementary suggestions and cautions will
greatly shorten the apprenticeship of one who does not have the good fortune
to be taught by a professional photographer. To the student of
ecology, the camera is not a toy. It must be understood and operated with
as much thoroughness as any other instrument, and when this is done, the
results will be equally certain and desirable.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>236. The camera and its accessories.</b> Although two cameras are desirable
whenever it is possible to obtain them, a single one will meet all the
requirements of field work. This should be 4 × 5 inches in size, since it is
much more convenient and will do all the work that a larger camera can. In
the comparatively few cases in which larger views are needed, the 4 × 5
negatives can be readily enlarged. The smaller instrument is less expensive
in operation because of the cheapness of the plates, and it gives a negative
of the proper size for lantern slides and for reproduction. A 6½ × 8½
camera is valuable in special cases, such as making a series of photographs
for maps. In the writer’s own experience, the 6½ × 8½ camera, although
used exclusively at first, has been almost completely supplanted by the
4 × 5. The best field camera is of the folding type with a good stout box.
It must be what is known technically as a long focus instrument, which
enables small objects to be taken natural size and permits the use of a
telephoto lens. It should be provided with a swing and also a reversible back
by which the position of the plates can be changed instantly. The lens must
be of the telephoto pattern, which makes it possible to use the front or
back lens either alone or in combination. The chief advantage of this is
that the image, when distant, may be made of three different sizes without
changing the position of the camera. Generally speaking, the high-priced
rapid lenses are the best, since it is exceptional to get the desired length of
exposure in vegetation, on account of the ease with which the plants move
in the wind. Before buying such a lens it is desirable to test its rapidity
and depth of focus, since it is not necessarily better than some of the lenses
furnished with good cameras. The lens should be provided with an iris
diaphragm capable of being stopped down to 128 or 256. The shutters
furnished with the ordinary lenses are satisfactory, since “snap-shots,”
i. e., instantaneous exposures, are practically never possible for plants. The
automatic shutter of the “Premo” camera is an especially convenient form.
All shutters should be carefully tested before using to determine the exact
time value of the exposures indicated. It is not uncommon for the exposure
at 1 second, or at other points, to have a value quite different from the one
indicated. When this is the case, it is evident that it can not be known too
soon. The camera should have at least a half-dozen double plate-holders.
These are numbered consecutively so that the figure uppermost when the
holder is in the camera will indicate the number of the plate exposed. A
carrying case is desirable on a long trip when all the plate-holders must
be taken, but ordinarily it is a disadvantage, since the camera box will carry
two or three holders. The camera cloth should be as small and light as
possible, and at the same time opaque. The most satisfactory one for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>field is the rubber cloth. The tripod should be a happy combination of
lightness and stability, a condition more nearly reached by the aluminum
tripod than by any other. It should have not less than three joints in order
to facilitate the use of the long focus upon objects near the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>237. Choice of a camera.</b> There is not a great deal of choice between
the moderate-priced cameras of the various makers. A field camera is restricted
to certain special uses, and hence is more serviceable when attachments
useful only in portraiture or instantaneous work are absent. Even the
ray filter, which has some value in the indoor photography of flowers, is useless
in the field on account of the long exposure required. From considerable
experience, “Premo” and “Korona” cameras have been found to be
very satisfactory instruments. Doubtless the same statement would be
found true of all the standard makes, but they have not been used by the
writer. “Premo” cameras are made by the Rochester Optical Co., Rochester,
N. Y., and “Korona” cameras by the Gundlach-Manhattan Optical Co.,
Rochester, N. Y. When two or more cameras are used, the best results can
be obtained if they are of the same make, since the details of operation are
then the same. The reduced liability of making a blunder is often offset
by the fact that a different pattern will permit of a wider range of use.
Any standard brand of plates will produce good negatives when skilfully
used; at least, this has been proved in the case of the Cramer, Hammer,
Seed, and Stanley brands. Every professional photographer has his favorite
brand of plate, but the ecologist will do well to give the various kinds a
thorough trial, and then to invariably use the one which gives him the best
results. Thus, while it seems to be less popular with the profession than
the others mentioned, the writer has obtained at least as satisfactory results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>with the Stanley plate as with the others, and consequently now uses it
exclusively, since it is cheaper. The one important point is to make a final
choice only after personal experience, and then to always use plates of the
same brand, and preferably of the same rate of speed.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>238. The use of the camera.</b> To the ecologist, objects to be photographed
fall into two categories, viz., those that move, and those that do
not move. For practical purposes, areas sufficiently distant to render the
movement imperceptible belong to the latter, as well as those, such as rock
lichens, many fungi, etc., which can not be stirred by ordinary winds. The
treatment accorded the two is essentially different. A fundamental rule of
ecological photography is that detail must receive the first emphasis. The
ecological view should be a picture as well as a map, however, but when one
must be sacrificed, artistic effect must yield to clearness, and accuracy, i. e.,
technically speaking, contrast must give way to detail. Leaving apart the
necessity of securing a sharp focus, which holds for all work, detail or definition
depends directly upon the aperture of the diaphragm. Detail is increased
by decreasing the size of the aperture. This in turn increases the
length of time necessary for a proper exposure, and consequently the danger
that the plant will be moved in the midst of the exposure. When the movement
is negligible, the invariable rule should be to reduce the aperture to its
smallest size, and to expose for a corresponding time. In all cases where
the plants are close enough to show even a slight blurring on account of the
action of the wind, the time of exposure must be reduced, in the hope that
a short period of quiet will suffice for it. This reduction in time must be
compensated by increasing the aperture of the diaphragm, and hence the
amount of light which strikes the plate. The proper balance between the
two is a matter of considerable nicety. It depends much upon the vagaries
of the wind, and can readily be determined only after considerable experience.
Although regions naturally differ somewhat in the nature of their
winds, much experience in prairie and mountain regions warrants the
primary rule that views of vegetation and plants subject to movement are
not to be attempted on windy or cloudy days when it can possibly be avoided.
Even on reconnaissance, a poor picture is no better than none at all, while
in resident work a time will come sooner or later which will permit the
making of a view satisfactory in all respects. There may be occasional instances
when one is rewarded for keeping the camera trained on a particular
spot for hours, and for wasting several plates in the hope that still moments
will prove to be of the requisite duration. As a regular procedure,
however, this has nothing to commend it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Various methods have been tried to reduce or eliminate the trouble caused
by the wind. Canvas screens have been used for this purpose with some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>benefit. When the picture is worth the trouble, a tent may be erected to
afford a very efficient protection. This is too prodigal of time and energy,
however, to be practicable under the usual conditions. Flashlight exposures
on still nights are sometimes feasible, but the disadvantages connected with
them are too great to bring them into general use. The best procedure is
to bide one’s time, and to take quadrats, transects, and other detail areas,
as well as many plant groups, at a time that promises to be most favorable.
Single plants can often be moved in the field so that they are protected from
the wind, or so that they are more strongly lighted. Slender, or feathery
plants are usually very difficult to handle out of doors. The best plan is to
photograph them in a room that is well and evenly lighted, or, best of all,
in a stable, roomy tent.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>239. The sequence of details.</b> No photographer ever escapes blunders
entirely. At the outset of his work, the ecologist must fully realize this,
and accordingly plan a method of operating the camera which will reduce
the chance of mistake to a minimum. The usual blunders which every
one makes sooner or later, such as making two exposures on one
plate, drawing the slide before closing the shutter, allowing the light to
strike the plate through the slit in the holder, etc., can be all but absolutely
avoided by a fixed order of doing things. This order will naturally not be
the same for different persons; it is necessary merely that each have his own
invariable sequence. The following one will serve as an illustration. As a
preliminary, the plate-holders are filled, after having been carefully dusted,
and the slides are uniformly replaced with the black edge inward. It is a
wise precaution to again see that all the slides are in this position before
leaving the dark room. This will ensure that a black edge outward always
means that the plate has been exposed. The tripod is first set up and placed
in what seems about the proper position. The camera is next attached to it,
and the front and back opened. The bellows is pulled out, a short distance
for views, and a longer one for detail pictures, and fastened. It is necessary
to move the diaphragm index to the largest aperture and to open the shutter
at “time.” The next steps are to orient the view or object, and to bring it
into sharp focus upon the ground glass. The first is accomplished by moving
the entire instrument, changing the position of the tripod legs, swinging the
camera upon the tripod, or by raising or lowering the lens front. It is often
desirable also to change the position of the object on the plate by use of the
reversible back. In views with much distance, the foreground is brought
into sharp focus. In close views, especially of quadrats, the swing is used
to increase the distance for the foreground, and the focus is made upon the
center. After focusing, the shutter is closed, the indicator set at the time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>desired, and the diaphragm “stopped down” as far as possible. Plate-holder
1 is slipped into place, care being taken not to move the camera by a sudden
jar. The camera cloth is dropped above the holder and allowed to hang
down over the slide end. The slide is drawn and put on top of the instrument,
the black edge always up. The exposure is made and the slide replaced
<em>with the black edge outward</em>. This point should receive the most critical
attention, as a blunder here will often cause the loss of two negatives. The
plate-holder is returned to the receptacle, or merely placed in the back of
the camera, which is then closed. The number of the plate, the name of the
view or object, the condition of the light, the length of exposure, and the
aperture of the diaphragm, as well as the date, are recorded in a notebook
for this purpose. The shutter is then opened at “time,” the diaphragm
thrown wide open, and the front of the camera closed. When distances are
short, the camera is often carried upon the tripod. As a rule, however, it is
usually removed, and the tripod folded. In making subsequent pictures,
the plates should always be used in their numerical order.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>240. The time of exposure</b> is obviously the most critical task in the
manipulation of a camera. The time necessary for a proper exposure varies
with the season, the hour, the condition of the sky, the light intensity of
the formation, the color and size of the area to be photographed, and, finally,
of course, with the aperture of the diaphragm. Fortunately for the ecologist,
the variation in light intensity during the season, and even during the
greater part of the day, is not great, and can ordinarily be ignored. The
beginner will make the most progress by determining the exposure demanded
by his instrument for taking a general view in full sunlight and with
the smallest stop of the diaphragm. In standard cameras with lenses of
ordinary rapidity, this is usually about one second. This will serve as a
basis from which all other exposures may be reckoned until one has worked
through a wide range of conditions and can recall just what time each view
requires. On completely cloudy days the time required is five to ten times
that necessary on a clear day; filmy clouds and haze necessitate an exposure
of two or three seconds. The more open forest formations demand an exposure
of about five to ten seconds on a sunny day, while the deeper ones
require two or three times as long. A close view requires more time than
a distant one, since the light-reflecting surface is much smaller. Quadrats
require two or three seconds, and individual groups frequently take a longer
time. The color of the vegetation plays an important part also: a dark green
spruce forest requires twice as long an exposure as the aspen forest, and a
grassland quadrat takes more time than one located in a gravel slide. In
this connection, it is hardly necessary to point out that the lighted side of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>objects should always be taken, never the shaded one. The exposures indicated
above are based upon the smallest stop. The reasons for using this
whenever possible have already been given. When a larger stop is necessary,
the exposure is decreased to correspond; for example, a quadrat that takes
three to four seconds at 256 can be taken at 64 in one second. As a rule,
the sun should not be in front of the camera, but, when necessary, views can
be made in this position if the sun is prevented from shining directly into
the lens.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>241. Developing</b> is as important as exposing. Indeed, it may well be
considered more important, since a properly exposed plate may be spoiled in
developing, while an under-exposure or over-exposure may be saved.
Owing to the ease with which plants move in the wind, the ecologist is
obliged to reconcile himself to many under-exposures, which can be converted
into good negatives only by skilful developing. Every base station
should have a good dark room, equipped with running water when possible,
a good ruby lantern, and the proper trays and chemicals. Prepared developing
solutions are alluring because of their convenience, but after an extended
trial of several kinds, the writer has reached the conviction that pyrogallic
acid, or “pyro,” is by far the most satisfactory in working with vegetation.
Of almost innumerable formulae, the following gives excellent satisfaction
and is convenient to use.</p>

<p class='c029'>For developing, equal parts of I and II are mixed, and a few drops of a
10 per cent solution of potassium bromide added, unless there is reason
to suspect that the plate has been seriously underexposed. The fixing
bath is a concentrated solution of sodium hyposulphite, “hypo,” to which
a few drops of acetic acid are added. It should be replaced every week or
two, depending upon how much it is used. A tray of water is kept at hand
for bringing out the detail in underexposed negatives, and a second tray
is used for washing. The “pyro” and the bromide solution should always
be within reach, the former for accelerating, and the latter for retarding
the development of unsatisfactory plates.</p>

<p class='c007'>The image will begin to show on a properly exposed plate within one
to three minutes after it has been put in the developer. If the image
appears almost instantly, and then recedes quickly, the plate is badly overexposed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>and should be thrown away. In case it “comes up” less quickly,
indicating that it is not greatly overexposed, it can be saved by the addition
of more bromide. When the image does not show till the end of five to
ten minutes, the plate has been underexposed. It is then necessary to add
more “pyro,” taking care not to pour it on the plate, and, after the image
appears with its striking contrast, to leave the plate in water until as much
detail as possible is brought out in the shadows. In the case of a normal
exposure, when greater detail is desired, the negative is left for some time
in water, and when contrast is sought more “pyro” is used. Negatives
with unusual detail lack “snap”; they are “flat,” and fail to make artistic
pictures. Contrast, on the other hand, often obscures detail, and the best
results can only be obtained by a happy combination of the two. The
most important maxim in developing is that the process shall be continued
until the image has become indistinct. The universal tendency of
the beginner is to remove the negative the moment the outlines grow
dimmer, and the result is a thin, lifeless negative. It is almost impossible
to develop too far, if the image is not allowed to disappear. Negatives of
this sort are “thick,” and though they print more slowly, produce brilliant
pictures. A large quantity of the developing solution is used with single
plates in small trays, and is allowed to act without rocking the tray. Much
time is saved, however, by developing several plates together, and to avoid
using a large quantity of the solution, the tray is gently rocked from time
to time. This movement is particularly necessary at the beginning, in
order that the plates may be covered evenly, and at once. Fifty cubic centimeters
of the solution will develop three or four 6½ × 8½ plates, and twice
as many 4 × 5’s. After the developer has once been used, it is kept for
several days to restrain overexposed plates. As soon as the plate is
developed, it is rinsed in water, and placed in the fixing fluid, until the
white opaqueness is entirely removed. The “hypo” is then washed out
by immersing the negatives for one to two hours in running water. If the
latter can not be secured, the water in which they are placed should be
changed frequently. The negatives are then air-dried within doors, in a
place free from dust. Finally, they are filed away in negative envelopes,
each bearing the name and number of the negative, and preferably also,
the time and other exposure data.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>242. Finishing.</b> On account of the time demanded by other field tasks,
it has not been found desirable to make and finish prints in the field. This,
with the making of lantern slides, enlargements, etc., may well be turned
over to a professional photographer. It is the custom to make a proof of
each negative to meet the casual needs that arise in the field. For this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>purpose, solio “seconds” are used, since they are both cheap and satisfactory.
When an urgent demand for a finished print does arise, it is met by using
“velox” paper, which can be exposed in the dark room, and then developed
and fixed exactly like a plate. Two standard papers for views are “solio”
and “platina.” The former gives brown tones, and is used for contrast and
brilliancy, hence it is especially good for printing from negatives that have
too much detail and too little contrast. “Platina,” on the contrary, yields
soft gray tones, and softens contrasts.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>FORMATION AND SUCCESSION HERBARIA</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>243. Concept and purpose.</b> A formation herbarium is a collection of
exsiccati, in which the species are arranged with respect to their position
in the formation, instead of being grouped in genera and families. Its
primary purpose is to furnish a record of the constitution and the structure
of a formation or a series of formations. At the same time, it affords the
basal material for developing the subject of comparative phytogeography.
It is impossible for one ecologist to visit many remote regions, to say nothing
of spending a period sufficient for obtaining even a fair knowledge of
the vegetation. He can at the best acquire an acquaintance with but few
regions at first hand. In consequence, a method that brings a vegetation to
him, with its structure carefully wrought out by years of study, is of the
highest value. Time, as well as distance, sets a narrow limit to the number
of formations which one man can investigate critically in a lifetime. It
is no longer possible for a botanist to explore vast regions, and to bring
back results which have anything more than a very general value. This
fact, far from restricting the comparative study of vegetation, will serve
to make it more accurate and systematic. The exact results of numerous
resident investigators, expressed in formation herbaria, with the proper
series of quadrat maps and photographs, will be worked over by men who
are themselves specially acquainted with a particular vegetation. Comparisons
will be founded upon a definite basis, and the relationship of various
vegetations can then be expressed in precise rather than general terms. It
is hardly too sweeping to assert that accurate work in the field of comparative
phytogeography can be done only in this fashion. The value of formation
herbaria in class work is evident. On account of the limitations of
time and distance, classes can touch but few formations, and these at every
time except the growing period. For these reasons, an accurate and complete
formational record that can be consulted or studied at any time is
almost indispensable to class study in the development and structure of
formations.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span><b>244. Details of collecting.</b> Formational collections, unlike the ordinary
sets of exsiccati, can not be made upon the first visit to a region, or by
a single journey through it. The determination of formation limits, and
of developmental stages, of aspects, layers, abundance, etc., must necessarily
precede, a work which alone takes several years. Moreover, collecting itself
requires more than one year in a region containing numerous formations.
This is exemplified by the <em>Herbaria Formationum Coloradensium</em>.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c017'><sup>[23]</sup></a> The
preliminary study for this was made from 1896–1899, the collecting was
done chiefly in 1900 and 1901, while additional numbers were added in
1902–3. For the purposes of the formation herbarium, specimens should
be collected and pressed in such fashion as to show all the ecological features
possible. Plants must be collected both in flower and in fruit, with
the underground parts as perfect as may be. Seedlings and rosettes should
be included whenever present. In pressing, one or two leaves should be
arranged with the lower side uppermost to admit of the ready comparison
of both surfaces. Opened flowers are valuable for flower biology, while
seeds and fruits are desirable for showing migration contrivances. The
ferns, mosses, and lichens of the formation should be fully represented, together
with the more important fungi and algae. The number of photographs
taken for each herbarium should be limited only by considerations
of time and expense. The ideal series consists of a general view of each
formation, showing its physiographic setting, nearer views of each of its
aspects, detail views of its consocies, societies, and layers, and flower portraits
of all the constituent species. Such a series can only be obtained by residence
through a long term of years, and in most cases general and aspect
views, with portraits of the facies and a few of the striking principal
species, must suffice. Quadrat and transect charts, together with formational
maps, are extremely desirable, and, indeed, all but indispensable.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>245. Arrangement.</b> The arrangement of species within each formation
herbarium is based upon the structure of the vegetation. The primary
groupings are made with reference to time of appearance and abundance;
when definite zones, associations, or layers are present, they must likewise
be taken into account. In the Colorado collection, the first division is into
three aspects based upon the period of flowering (<em>aspectus vernalis</em>, <em>aestivalis</em>,
<em>autumnalis</em>). Within each aspect, the species are arranged with respect
to abundance in the groups, facies, principal species, and secondary
species. Each group is placed in an ordinary manila cover, which bears a
printed label indicating the aspect and the group. The species labels give,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>in addition to the name, date, and place of collection, the phyad or vegetation
form, the geographical area, the rank of the species, the aspect, and
the formation. To these may well be added data concerning migration
contrivances, seed production, pollination, period of flowering, etc. The
photographs are mounted on the usual herbarium sheets, and placed in the
proper order in the various groups, and a similar disposition is made of
quadrat and transect charts, and such physical factor summaries as seem
desirable.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>246. Succession herbaria.</b> The arrangement of formation herbaria may
follow the classification of formations with respect to character, region, or
development. The first is the most convenient for purposes of instruction,
and has distinct advantages in permitting a close comparison of the vegetation
of different habitats. The second basis, which is the one used in the
<em>Herbaria Formationum Coloradensium</em>, is peculiarly adapted to mountain
vegetation in which the zones are usually very distinct. The arrangement
of herbaria in a developmental series, however, is the most logical and the
most illuminating, since the structure of the ultimate formations is not only
made plain, but the stages in their development are also laid bare. Such
succession herbaria are the natural outgrowth of formational ones. Indeed,
the latter should be made merely the starting point for these in all regions
where the causes which bring about successions are active. Where weathering
is still an important factor, as in mountains, the initial and intermediate
formations which lead to the final grassland or forest are often in evidence.
After a formation herbarium of each stage has been made in the way indicated,
a succession herbarium is obtained merely by arranging the various
herbaria in the sequence of the developmental stages. Thus, in the Colorado
collection, the subalpine formations are arranged according to altitude
in the following series: (1) the pine formation, (2) the gravel slide formation,
(3) the half gravel slide formation, (4) the aspen formation,
(5) the balsam-spruce formation, (6) the spruce-pine formation, (7) the
meadow thicket formation, (8) the brook bank formation. Of these, five
belong to the same succession, and it is possible to indicate the development
of the spruce-pine forest by arranging these five formations in their proper
order in a succession herbarium, as follows: (1) the gravel slide formation,
(2) the half gravel slide formation, (3) the pine formation, (4) the balsam-spruce
formation, (5) the spruce-pine formation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
  <h4 class='c018'><span class='sc'>Development and Structure</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>247. Vegetation an organism.</b> The plant formation is an organic unit.
It exhibits activities or changes which result in development, structure, and
reproduction. These changes are progressive, or periodic, and, in some
degree, rhythmic, and there can be no objection to regarding them as
functions of vegetation. According to this point of view, the formation is
a complex organism, which possesses functions and structure, and passes
through a cycle of development similar to that of the plant. This concept
may seem strange at first, owing to the fact that the common understanding
of function and structure is based upon the individual plant alone. Since
the formation, like the plant, is subject to changes caused by the habitat,
and since these changes are recorded in its structure, it is evident that
the terms, function and structure, are as applicable to the one as to the
other. It is merely necessary to bear in mind that the functions of plants
and of formations are absolutely different activities, which have no more
in common than do the two structures, leaf and zone.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>248. Vegetation essentially dynamic.</b> As an organism, the formation
is undergoing constant change. Constructive or destructive forces are
necessarily at work; the former, as in the plant, predominate until maturity,
when the latter prevail. Consequently, it no longer seems fruitful to classify
the phenomena of vegetation as dynamic or static. The emphasis which
has been placed upon dynamic aspects of vegetation has served a useful
purpose by calling attention to the development of the latter. Although it
is a quarter of a century since Hult, and more than a half century since
Steenstrup, by far the greater number of ecological studies still ignore the
problem of development. This condition, however, can be remedied more
easily by insisting upon an exact understanding of the nature of the formation
than in any other way. It is entirely superfluous to speak of dynamic
and static effects in the plant, and the use of these terms with reference
to the formation becomes equally unnecessary as soon as the latter is
looked upon as an organism. The proper investigation of a formation can
no more overlook development than structure, so closely are the two interwoven.
Future research must rest squarely upon this fact.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>249. Functions and structures.</b> The functions of a formation are association,
invasion, and succession: the second may be resolved into migration
and ecesis, and the third, perhaps, into reaction and competition.
Formational structures comprise zones, layers, consocies, societies, etc., all
of which may be referred to zonation, or to alternation. The term association
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>has been used in both an active and a passive sense. In the former, it
applies to the inevitable grouping together of plants, by means of reproduction
and immobility. Passively, it refers to the actual groupings which
result in this way, and in this sense it is practically synonymous with vegetation.
Invasion is the function of movement, and of occupying or taking
possession; with association, it constitutes the two fundamental activities
of vegetation. It is the essential part of succession, but the latter is so
distinctive, because of the intimate relation of competition and reaction,
that clearness is gained by treating it as a separate function
which is especially concerned with development. Association, zonation,
and alternation are structural phenomena, which are in large part the
immediate product of habitat and function, and in a considerable degree,
also, the result of ancestral or historical facts. It is a difficult matter to
determine in what measure the last factor enters, but it is one that must
always be taken into account, particularly when the physical factors of
the habitat are inadequate to explain the structures observed. Structurally,
association regularly includes both zonation and alternation. As there are
certain typical instances in which it exhibits neither, the treatment will be
clearer if each is considered separately.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ASSOCIATION</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>250. Concept.</b> The principle of association is the fundamental law of
vegetation. Indeed, association is vegetation, for the individual passes into
vegetation, strictly speaking, at the moment when other individuals of the
same kind or of different kinds become grouped with it. It is then (and
the same statement necessarily holds for vegetation) the coming together
and the staying together of individuals and, ultimately, of species. A concrete
instance will illustrate this fact. In the development of the blowout
formation of the Nebraska sand-hills (<em>Redfieldia-Muhlenbergia-anemium</em>),
association begins only when the first plant of <em>Redfieldia flexuosa</em>
is joined by other plants that have sprung from it, or have wandered in over
the margin of the blowout. Henceforth, whatever changes the blowout formation
may undergo, association is a settled characteristic of it until some
new and overwhelming physical catastrophe shall destroy the associated
individuals. It will readily be seen that association does not depend upon
particular individuals, for these pass and others take their place, but that
it does depend essentially upon number of individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Association involves the idea of the relation of plants to the soil, as well
as that of plants to each other. It is synonymous with vegetation only
when the two relations are represented, since there may be association such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>as that of a parasite with its host, which does not constitute vegetation.
But it will be seen that the relation of the parasite to the host is practically
identical with the relation of the plant to the soil or stratum, and the two
concepts mentioned above become merged in such a case. From this it
follows that association results in vegetation only when the two ideas are
distinct. The concept of association contains a fact that is everywhere
significant of vegetation, namely, the likeness or unlikeness of the individuals
which are associated. In the case of parasite and host, this unlikeness
is marked; in vegetation, all degrees of similarity obtain. As will be evident
when the causes which lead to association are considered, alternate
similarity and dissimilarity of the constituent individuals or species is subordinate
as a feature of vegetation only to the primary fact of association.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since association contains two distinct, though related, ideas, it is of
necessity ambiguous. It is very desirable that this be avoided, in order that
each concept may be clearly delimited. For this reason, the act or process
of grouping individuals is termed <em>aggregation</em>, while the word association
is restricted to the condition or state of being grouped together. In a
word, aggregation is functional, association is structural; the one is the
result of the other. This distinction makes clear the difference between
association in the active and passive sense, and falls in with the need of
keeping function and structure in the foreground.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>251. Causes.</b> In considering the causes which produce association, it
is necessary to call in evidence the primary facts of the process in concrete
examples of this principle. These facts are so bound up in the nature of
vegetal organisms that they are the veriest axioms. Reproduction gives
rise immediately to potential, and ultimately, in the great majority of cases,
to actual association. The degree and permanence of the association are
then determined by the immobility of the individuals as expressed in terms
of attachment to each other or to the stratum, such as sheath, thallus,
haustoria, holdfasts, rhizoids, roots, etc. The range of immobility is very
great. In terrestrial plants, mobility is confined almost entirely to the
period when the individual lies dormant in the seed, spore, or propagative
part, which is alone mobile. In aquatic spermatophytes, the same is true
of all attached forms, while free floating plants such as <em>Lemna</em> are mobile
in a high degree, especially during the vegetative period. Among the
algae and hydrophilous fungi, attached forms are mobile only in the spore
or propagative condition, while the motile forms of the plancton typify the
extreme development of mobility. The immediate result of reproduction
in an immobile species is to produce association of like individuals, while in
the case of a mobile species reproduction may or may not lead immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>to association. We may lay down the general principle that immobility tends
to maintain the association of the individuals of the same generation, i. e.,
the association of like forms, while mobility tends to separate the similar
individuals of one generation and to bring unlike forms together. With
the mobile algae, separation of the members of each generation is the rule,
unless the individuals come to be associated in a thallus, or are grouped in
contact with the substratum. Flowering plants that are relatively immobile,
especially in the seed state, drop their seeds beneath and about the parent
plants, and in consequence dense association of the new plants is the rule.
In very many cases, however, this primitive tendency is largely or completely
negatived by the presence of special dissemination contrivances, which are
nearly, if not quite, as effective for many terrestrial plants as the free floating
habit is for algae. From this point, the whole question of mobility belongs
to migration, just as the adjustment between the parent plants and
their offspring, or between plants established and the mobile plants to be
established, belongs to competition.</p>

<p class='c007'>If association were determined by reproduction and immobility alone, it
would exhibit areas dissimilar in the mass of individuals, as well as areas
dissimilar in the kinds of individuals. Some areas would be occupied by
plants of a single species, others by plants of several or many species. This
tendency of association to show differences is, however, greatly emphasized
by the fact that vegetation is fundamentally attached to and dependent upon
a surface that exhibits the most extreme physical differences. For this reason,
new differences in association appear, due not only to the morphological
differentiation of vegetation forms, but also to the changes in the degree and
manner of association produced directly by the different habitats. Association
might then be defined as a grouping together of plant individuals, of
parents and progeny, which is initiated by reproduction and immobility, and
determined by environment. It is a resultant of differences and similarities.
In consequence, association in its largest expression, vegetation, is essentially
heterogeneous, while in those areas which possess physical or biological
definiteness, habitats and vegetation centers, it is relatively homogeneous.
This fundamental peculiarity has given us the concept of the
formation, an area of vegetation, or a particular association, which is homogeneous
within itself, and at the same time essentially different from contiguous
areas, though falling into a phylogenetic series with some and a
biological series with others. From its nature, the plant formation is to be
considered the logical unit of vegetation, though it is not, of course, the
simplest example of association.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span><b>252. Aggregation.</b> As indicated under the causes of association, the
process by which groups of individuals are formed depends entirely upon
reproduction and migration. In short, aggregation is merely a corollary of
movement. The simplest example of this process occurs in forms like <em>Gloeocapsa</em>,
<em>Tetraspora</em>, and others, where the plants resulting from fission are
held together by means of a sheath. Though called a colony, such a group
of individuals is a family in the ordinary sense. Practically the same grouping
results in the case of terrestrial plants, especially spermatophytes, when
the seeds of a plant mature and fall to the ground about it. The relation in
both instances is essentially that of parent and offspring, although the parent
soon disappears in the case of annuals, while among the algae its existence
is regularly terminated by fission. The size and the density of the family
group are determined by the number of seeds produced, and by their mobility.
These are further affected by the height and branching of the plant,
and by the position of the seeds upon it. The disseminules of immobile
species fall directly beneath the parent, and the resulting group is both uniform
and definite. A similar arrangement is caused likewise by offshoots.
An increase in mobility brings about a decrease of aggregation, since the
disseminules are carried away from the parent plant. Perfectly mobile
forms rarely produce family groups for this reason. It is evident, however,
that mobile perennials sometimes arrange themselves in similar fashion in
consequence of propagation by underground parts. Consequently, it is possible
to state the law of single aggregation, viz., that immobility promotes
the grouping of parent and offspring, and mobility hinders it.</p>

<p class='c007'>If all species were immobile, the family group would be characteristic of
vegetation. Since the great majority are more or less mobile, aggregates
of this sort are the exception rather than the rule. Mobility not only decreases
the number of offspring in the family group, but it also spreads disseminules
broadcast to enter dissimilar groups. It leads directly to mixed
aggregation, by which individuals of one or more species invade the family
group. Once established, the newcomers tend also to produce simple groups,
thus causing an arrangement corresponding essentially to a community.
Such collections of family groups are extremely variable in size and definition.
This arises in part from the nature of simple aggregation, and in part
from the varying mobility of different species. Mobility alone often produces
similar communities by bringing together the disseminules of different
plants, each of which then becomes the center of a mixed group. In the
case of permobile species, several disseminules of each may be brought together.
The resulting area, though larger, is practically the same. At present,
it is difficult to formulate the law for this method of grouping. It may
be stated provisionally as follows: mixed aggregation is the direct result of
mobility, and the greater the mobility the more heterogeneous the mixture.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>The constitution of all the major areas of a formation is to be explained
upon the basis of aggregation by the two methods described. The relative
importance of family groups and communities differs for every formation,
and the exact procedure in each can be obtained only by the detailed study
of quadrats. The problem is further complicated by competition and reaction,
particularly in closed vegetation. For this reason, aggregation can be
studied most satisfactorily in a new or denuded area, where these processes
are not yet in evidence.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Kinds of Association</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>253. Categories.</b> In the analysis of association, it must be kept clearly in
mind that the concrete examples from which all generalizations must be
drawn are often in very different stages of development, and are of correspondingly
different ages. For this reason it has seemed best to consider
the primary relations of association in general in this place, leaving the
treatment of the effects of invasion, succession, alternation, and zonation to
be taken up under these topics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Various categories of association may be distinguished, according to the
dominant physical factor concerned or the point of view taken. These will
fall into two series, as we consider the relation of plant to plant with reference
to some object or characteristic, or the grouping of plants together in
response to some dominant factor. In the first series may be placed association
with reference to substratum, to the ground (occupation), and to
invasion; in the second belong light and water-content association. It
should be noted that these are all actual associations in nature, and not concepts
such as the vegetation form, within which plants from widely different
associations may be classified. Naturally, it does not follow that it is not
logical or valuable to group together those plants, such as hydrophytes,
sciophytes, hysterophytes, etc., which have a common relation to some factor,
but belong to different formations.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>254. Stratum association.</b> Plants manifest independent or dependent association
with reference to the stratum to which they are attached and from
which they derive food or support. Independent association is exhibited by
those holophytic species of a formation which are entirely independent of
each other with respect to mechanical support or nutrition. It is characteristic
of the greater number of the constituent species of formations. Dependent
association is manifested in the relation between host and parasite,
stratum and epiphyte, support and liane. Warming<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c017'><sup>[24]</sup></a> has distinguished six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>kinds of associations: parasitism, helotism, mutualism, epiphytism, lianism,
and commensalism. Commensalism corresponds to the primary principle
of association which has given rise to vegetation. Homogeneous commensalism
is the term applied to social exclusive plants, in which the patch is
composed of a single species. Such association is extremely rare in nature,
and if the most minute forms be considered, probably never occurs. On the
other hand, heterogeneous commensalism, in which individuals of more than
one species are present, is everywhere typical of vegetation. Warming regards
saprophytism merely as a specialized kind of parasitism, an opinion
that may well be defended. Helotism, however, is also a mere modification
of parasitism, if it is not indeed parasitism pure and simple. Mutualism is
an altogether vague concept, including parasites, epiphytes, and endophytes
of doubtful physiological relation. Pound and Clements<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c017'><sup>[25]</sup></a> treated lianes, parasites,
and saprophytes as vegetation forms, relating herbaceous creepers
and twiners to the lianes, and dividing the fungi and lichens into nine
groups. Whatever the value of these divisions may be from the standpoint
of vegetation forms, they represent the same relation between plant and nutritive
stratum, and with respect to association should be merged in one
group. Schimper<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c017'><sup>[26]</sup></a> was the first to perceive the essential similarity of all
such groups from the standpoint of association. He terms these plant societies
(<em>Genossenschaften</em>), retaining the four groups already established,
lianae, epiphyta, saprophyta, and parasiticae. It is evident that dependent
association comprises extremely divergent forms, from the slightly clinging
herb, such as <em>Galium</em>, to the most intense parasite. The distinction, however,
is a clear one, if restricted to that relation between plants in which one
acts as a mechanical support or stratum or as a nutritive host for the other.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>255. Ground association.</b> The first division of formations into open and
closed was made by Engler and Drude.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c017'><sup>[27]</sup></a> Open formations were defined as
those having incomplete stability and heterogeneous composition, while
closed formations have a more definite uniform stamp. What is true of formations
is equally true of vegetation, so that association may be regarded
as open or closed with reference to the density and thoroughness with which
the plants occupy the ground. In open association, the ground is slightly
or partially occupied, readily permitting the entrance of new plants without
the displacement of those already present. Such an arrangement is characteristic
of the early stages of a formation, or of a succession of formations.
It produces unstable open formations, which arise, usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>after denudation, in sand-hills, blowouts, gravel slides, dunes, flood
plains, burned areas, etc. In closed association, occupation of the ground is
complete, and the invasion of new species can occur only through displacement.
Closed association results in stable, closed formations, such as forest,
thicket, meadow, and prairie. As open association characterizes the early
stages of a succession of formations, so closed association is peculiar to the
later or last stages of all such successions. In short, open formations represent
certain phases of the development of vegetation, while closed formations
correspond to the relatively final structural conditions. It is a fundamental
principle of association that every succession from denudation, or
from newly formed soils, begins with open formations and ends with a
closed formation. The causes leading up to open and closed association are
intimately connected with development, and hence are considered under invasion
and succession.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>256. Species guild association.</b> Drude has distinguished a kind of association
peculiar to invasion, in which there is a successive or concomitant
movement of certain species of a formation into another formation or region,
resulting in species guilds (<em>Artengenossenschaften</em>). The association in this
case is largely one of community of origin or area, and of concomitant migration.
It is especially characteristic of areas adjacent to formational and
regional limits. Fundamentally, it is merely the grouping of plants which
are invading at the same time, and consequently it differs only in degree
from what occurs in every invasion where more than a single individual is
concerned. Accordingly, this type of association has little more than historical
interest. This must not be construed to mean that it does not occur,
but that it differs in no essential from the ordinary grouping of invaders.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>257. Light association.</b> The constituent species of formations show two
fundamentally different groupings with respect to light. In the one case,
the individuals are on the same level, or nearly so, in such a way that each
has direct access to sunlight. Such an arrangement is characteristic of most
grassland and herbaceous formations. In the case of desert formations,
there is often considerable difference in the height of the plants, but the distance
between them is so great as to admit of direct illumination of all.
This arrangement may be termed coordinate association. In forests, thickets,
and many herbaceous wastes, the height and density of certain species
enable them to dominate the formation. In a dense forest, the trees receive
practically all the light incident upon the formation, and the shrubs, herbs,
fungi, and algae of lower habit and inferior position must adapt themselves
to the diffuse light which passes through or between the leaves. The same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>is equally true of dense thickets and wastes, except that the vertical distance
is less, and the diffuseness of the light is correspondingly modified. In these
formations, the dominant trees, shrubs, or herbs, the facies, constitute a primary
or superior layer. The degree of subordinate association, as a result
of which inferior layers will arise, is entirely determined by the density of
the facies. In open woodlands, which are really mixed formations of woodland
and grassland, the intervals, and usually the spaces beneath the trees
also, are covered with poophytes, showing an absence of subordination due
to light. This is the prevailing condition in the pine formation (<em>Pinus ponderosa-xerohylium</em>)
of the ridges and foot-hills of western Nebraska.
When, however, the trees stand sufficiently close that their shadows meet or
overlap throughout the day, the increasing diffuseness begins to cause modification
and rearrangement of the individuals. By photometric methods, the
light in a forest is found to be least diffuse just below the facies, while the
diffuseness increases markedly in passing to the ground. The taller,
stronger individuals are consequently in a position to assimilate more vigorously,
and to become still taller and stronger as a result. Just as these
have taken up a position inferior to that of the facies, so the shorter or
weaker species must come to occupy a still more subordinate position. This
results, not only because the light is primarily weaker nearer the ground,
but also because the taller plants interpose as a second screen. The complete
working out of this arrangement with reference to light produces typical
subordinate association, which finds its characteristic expression in the layering
of forests and thickets. Layers tend to appear as soon as open woodland
or thicket begins to pass into denser conditions, and up to a certain
point, at which they disappear, they become the more numerous and the
more marked, the denser the forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Otowanie woods near Lincoln (<em>Quercus-Hicoria-hylium</em>), layering
usually begins at a light value of .1 (1 = normal sunshine in the open).
Thornber<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c017'><sup>[28]</sup></a> has found the same value to obtain in the thickets of the Missouri
bluffs. In these, again, layers disappear at a value of .005, the extreme
diffuseness making assimilation impossible except for occasional mosses
and algae. A number of herbaceous plants are present in the spring, but
these are all prevernal or vernal bloomers, which are safely past flowering
before shade conditions become extreme. In the <em>Fraxinus-Catalpa-alsium</em>,
all inferior holophytic vegetation disappears between the light value of .004
and that of .003. The spruce-pine formation (<em>Picea-Pinus-hylium</em>) of the
Rocky mountains, with a light value of .01, usually contains but a few scattered
herbs, mostly evergreen; in some cases there are no subordinate plants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>other than mosses and hysterophytes. The lodge-pole pine formation (<em>Pinus
murrayana-hylium</em>), with light values often less than .005, is nearly or quite
destitute of all but hysterophytic undergrowth. Such extremely dense formations
are examples of coordinate association merely, since the formation
is reduced to a single superior layer, in which the individuals of the facies
bear the same spatial relation to incident light. In layered formations, in
addition to the subordinate relation of other species to the facies, there is, of
course, a kind of coordinate association manifested in each layer.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>258. Water-content association.</b> Schouw<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c017'><sup>[29]</sup></a> was the first to give definite
expression to the value of the water-content of the soil for the grouping of
plants. He established four groups: (1) water plants, (2) swamp plants,
(3) plants of moist meadows, (4) plants of dry soils. The first he termed
hydrophytes, introducing the term halophytes to include all saline plants.
Thurmann<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c017'><sup>[30]</sup></a> recognized the fundamental influence of water-content upon association,
and further perceived that the amount of water present was determined
primarily by the physical nature of the soil. He distinguished plants
which grow in soils that retain water as <em>hygrophilous</em>, and those found upon
soils that lose water readily as <em>xerophilous</em>. Those which seemed to grow
indifferently upon either were termed <em>ubiquitous</em>. The latter correspond in
some measure to mesophytes, but they are really plants possessing a considerable
range of adaptability, and do not properly constitute a natural
group. Warming<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c017'><sup>[31]</sup></a> proposed the term mesophytes to include all the plants
intermediate between hydrophytes and xerophytes. He recognized the paramount
value of water-content association as the basis of ecology, and upon
this made a logical and systematic treatise out of the scattered results of
many workers. Schimper<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c017'><sup>[32]</sup></a> placed the study of vegetation upon a new basis
by drawing a distinction between physical and physiological water-content,
and by pointing out that the last alone is to be taken into account in the
study of plant life, and hence of plant geography. Accepting the easily
demonstrable fact that an excess of salts in the soil water, as well as cold,
tends greatly to diminish the available water of the soil, i. e., the chresard,
it is at once seen why saline and arctic plants are as truly xerophytic as those
that grow on rocks or in desert sands. An anomalous case which, however,
physical factor records have explained fully, is presented by many plants
growing in alpine gravel slides, strands, blowouts, sandbars, etc., in which
the water-content is considerable, but the water loss excessive, on account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>of extreme heat or reduced air pressure. The effect of these conditions is
to produce a plant xerophytic as to its aerial parts, and mesophytic or even
hydrophytic as to subterranean parts. Such plants may, from their twofold
nature, be termed <em>dissophytes</em>; they are especially characteristic of dysgeogenous
soils in alpine regions where transpiration reaches a maximum, but
are doubtless to be found in all gravel and sand habitats with high water-content.
With these corrections, the concept of water-content association,
which owes much to both Warming and Schimper, but is largely to be credited
to Thurmann, becomes completely and fundamentally applicable to all
vegetation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to the present time, the general character of the habitat, together with
the gross appearance of the plant itself, has been thought sufficient to determine
the proper position of a plant or a formation in the water-content classification.
Such a method is adequate, however, only for plants and formations
which bear a distinct impress. For an accurate classification into the
three categories, hydrophytes, mesophytes, and xerophytes, it is necessary
to make exact determinations of the normal holard and chresard of the habitat,
and to supplement this, in some degree at least, by histological studies.
Except in the case of saline, acid, and frozen soils, the holard alone will be a
fairly accurate index, especially in habitats of similar soil composition. For
an exact and comprehensive classification, however, and particularly in comparative
work, the chresard must constitute the sole criterion. As the latter
has been ascertained for very few formations, and in Nebraska and Colorado
alone, the present characterization of many plants and formations as hydrophytic,
mesophytic, or xerophytic must be regarded as largely tentative, and
the final classification will be possible only after the thorough quantitative
investigation of their habitats.</p>

<p class='c007'>The water-content groups, hydrophytia, mesophytia, and xerophytia, include
all formations found upon the globe. The exactness with which this
classification applies to vegetation is made somewhat more evident by dividing
mesophytia into forest and grassland. This is based primarily upon light
association, but it also reflects water-content differences in a large degree.
The groups thus constituted represent the fundamental zonation of the vegetative
covering with respect to water-content. Ocean, forest, grassland,
and desert correspond exactly to hydrophytia, hylophytia, poophytia, and
xerophytia. The difference is merely one of terminology: the first series
takes into account the physiognomy of the vegetation itself, while the other
emphasizes the causative factors.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORMATION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>259.</b> A strict account of development should trace the results of the various
activities of vegetation in their proper sequence. This is aggregation,
migration, ecesis, reaction, and competition. These functions are so intimately
and often so inextricably associated that it is hardly feasible to discuss
development by treating each one separately. In consequence, the two
fundamental phenomena, invasion and succession, which they produce, are
taken as the basis of the discussion. These, moreover, are different only in
degree; succession is merely complete, periodic invasion. Nevertheless, the
subject gains in clearness by a separate treatment of each.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>INVASION</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>260.</b> By invasion is understood the movement of plants from an area of
a certain character into one of a different character, and their colonization
in the latter. This movement may concern an individual, a species, or a
group of species. From the nature of invasion, which contains the double
idea of going into and taking possession of, it usually operates between contiguous
formations, but it also takes place between formational zones and
patches. More rarely and less noticeably, there may be invasion into a remote
vegetation, as a result of long carriage by wind, water, birds, railroads,
or vessels. Movement or migration, however, represents but one of the two
ideas involved in invasion. Migration merely carries the spore, seed, or
propagule into the area to be invaded. In ecesis, the spores or seeds germinate
and grow, after more or less adjustment, and in case the latter becomes
sufficiently complete, the new plants reproduce and finally become established.
With all terrestrial plants, invasion is possible only when migration
is followed by ecesis, because of the inherent differences of formations or of
areas of the same formation. In the case of surface floating forms, such as
<em>Lemnaceae</em>, and of the plancton, ecesis is of much less importance, on account
of the uniformity of the medium and the lack of attachment, and
migration is often practically synonymous with invasion.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>MIGRATION</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>261.</b> Migration has been sometimes used loosely as a synonym for invasion,
but it is here employed in its proper sense of removal or departure, i. e.,
movement, and is contrasted with ecesis, the making of a home, the two
ideas being combined in invasion, which is a moving into and a taking possession
of. An analysis of migration reveals the presence of four factors,
mobility, agency, proximity, and topography. Not all of these are present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>in every instance of migration, as for example in the simple elongation of a
rootstalk, but in the great majority of cases each plays its proper part. Mobility
represents the inherent capacity of a plant for migration, and in its
highest expression, motility, is in itself productive of movement. As a general
rule, however, modifications for securing mobility are ineffective in the
absence of proper agents, and the effective operation of the two will be profoundly
influenced by distance and topography.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>262. Mobility</b> denotes potentiality of migration as represented by modifications
for this purpose. It corresponds, in a sense, to dissemination,
though seed production also enters into it. Its most perfect expression is
found in those plants which are themselves motile, <em>Bacteriaceae</em>, <em>Oscillatoria</em>,
<em>Volvocaceae</em>, and <em>Bacillariaceae</em>, or possess motile propagules, such as most
<em>Phycophyta</em>. On the other hand, it is entirely undeveloped in many plants
with heavy unspecialized seeds and fruits. Between these two extremes lie
by far the greater number of plants, exhibiting the most various degrees of
mobility, from the motile though almost immobile offshoots of many <em>Liliaceae</em>
to the immotile but very mobile spores of fungi. It is thus seen that
motility plays a relatively small part in migration, being practically absent
in terrestrial forms, and that it bears a very uncertain relation to mobility.
In analyzing the latter, contrivances for dissemination are seen to determine
primarily the degree of mobility, while the number of seeds produced will
have an important effect in increasing or decreasing it. A third factor of
considerable importance is also involved, namely, position with reference to
the distributive agent, but any exact knowledge of its importance must await
systematic experiment somewhat after the methods of Dingler, but with air-currents,
etc., of known velocity and direction. The time is not distant when
by such methods it will be possible to establish a coefficient of mobility, derived
from terms of position, weight, resistant surface, and trajectory for
definite wind velocities or for particular propulsive mechanisms.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>263. Organs for dissemination.</b> Plants exhibit considerable diversity
with reference to the part or organ modified, or at least utilized, for dissemination.
This modification, though usually affecting the particular product
of reproduction, may, in fact, operate on any part of the plant, and in certain
cases upon the entire plant itself. In the majority of plants characterized
by alternation of generations, the same individual may be disseminated in
one generation by a reproductive body, and in the other by a propagative
one, as is the case in the oogones and conidia of <em>Peronospora</em>, the spores and
gemmae of <em>Marchantia</em>, the fruits and runners of <em>Fragaria</em>, etc. Special
modifications have, as a rule, been developed in direct connection with spores
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>and seeds, and mobility reaches its highest expression in these. It is, on the
other hand, greatly restricted in offshoots and plant bodies, at least in terrestrial
forms, though it will now and then attain a marked development in
these, as shown by the rosettes of <em>Sempervivum</em> and the tumbling plants of
<em>Cycloloma</em>. For the sake of convenience, in analyzing migration, all plants
may be arranged in the following groups with reference to the organ or part
distributed.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Spore-distributed, sporostrotes. This includes all plants possessing
structures which go by the name of spore, such as the acinetes of Nostoc
and <em>Protococcus</em>, the zoogonidia of <em>Ulothrix</em>, <em>Ectocarpus</em>, etc., the conidia,
ascospores, and basidiospores of fungi, the tetraspores of red seaweeds, and
the gemmae and spores proper of liverworts, mosses, and ferns. These are
almost always without especial contrivances for dissemination, but their extreme
minuteness results in great mobility.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Seed-distributed, spermatostrotes. This group comprises all flowering
plants in which the seed is the part modified or at least disseminated. The
mobility of seeds is relatively small, except in the case of minute, winged or
comate seeds.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Fruit-distributed, carpostrotes. The modifications of the fruit for distribution
exceed in number and variety all other modifications of this sort.
All achenes, perigynia, utricles, etc., properly belong here.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Offshoot-distributed, thallostrotes. To this class are referred those
plants, almost exclusively cormophytes, which produce lateral, branch-like
propagules, such as root-sprouts, rhizomes, runners, stolons, rosettes, etc.
Migration with such plants is extremely slow, but correspondingly effective,
since it is almost invariably followed by ecesis.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Plant-distributed, phytostrotes. This group includes all plancton and
surface forms, whether motile or non-motile, and those terrestrial plants in
which the whole plant, or at least the aerial part, is distributed, as in tumbleweeds
and in many grasses.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>264. Contrivances for dissemination.</b> Any investigation of migration to
be exact must confine itself to fixed forms. For these the degree of perfection
shown by dissemination contrivances corresponds almost exactly to the
degree of mobility. Because of the difficulty of ascertaining the effect of
ecesis, it is impossible to determine the actual effectiveness in nature of different
modifications, and the best that can be done at present is to regard
mobility, together with the occurrence and forcefulness of distributive agents,
as an approximate measure of migration. The general accuracy of such a
measure will be more or less evident from the following. Of 118 species
common to the foot-hill and sand-hill regions of Nebraska, regions which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>sufficiently diverse to indicate that these common species must have entered
either one by migration from the other, 83 exhibit modifications for dissemination,
while 8 others, though without special contrivances, are readily distributed
by water, and 4 more are mobile because of minuteness of spore or
seed. Some degree of mobility is present in 73 per cent of the species common
to these regions, while of the total number of species in which the mode
of migration is evident, viz., 95, 66 per cent are wind-distributed, 20 per cent
animal-distributed, and 14 per cent are water-distributed. It need hardly be
noted that this accords fully with the prevalence and forcefulness of winds
in these regions. Of the species peculiar to the foot-hill region, many are
doubtless indigenous, though a majority have come from the montane regions
to the westward. The number of mobile species is 121, or 60 per cent of the
entire number, while the number of wind-distributed ones is 85, or 70 per
cent of those that are mobile. Among the 25 species found in the widely
separated wooded bluff and foot-hill regions, 2 only, <em>Amorpha nana</em> and
<em>Roripa nasturtium</em>, are relatively immobile, but the minute seeds of the latter,
however, are readily distributed, and the former is altogether infrequent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following groups of plants may be distinguished according to the
character of the contrivance by which dissemination is secured:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Saccate, saccospores. Here are to be placed a variety of fruits, all of
which agree, however, in having a membranous envelope or an impervious,
air-containing pericarp. In <em>Ostrya</em>, <em>Physalis</em>, <em>Staphylea</em>, the modification
is for wind-distribution, while in <em>Carex</em>, <em>Nymphaea</em>, etc., it is for water-transport.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Winged, pterospores. This group includes all winged, margined, and
flattened fruits and seeds, such as are found in <em>Acer</em>, <em>Betula</em>, <em>Rumex</em>, many
<em>Umbelliferae</em>, <em>Graminaceae</em>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Comate, comospores. To this group belong those fruits and seeds with
long silky hairs, <em>Gossypium</em>, <em>Anemone</em>, <em>Asclepias</em>, etc., and those with
straight capillary hairs or bristles not confined to one end, <em>Typha</em>, <em>Salix</em>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Parachute, petasospores. The highly developed members of this group,
<em>Taraxacum</em>, <em>Lactuca</em>, and other <em>Liguliflorae</em> are connected through Senecio
and <em>Eriophorum</em> with the preceding. These represent the highest development
of mobility attained by special modification.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Chaffy-pappose, carphospores. In this group are placed those achenes
with a more or less scaly or chaffy pappus with slight mobility, as in <em>Rudbeckia</em>,
<em>Brauneria</em>, <em>Helianthus</em>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Plumed, lophospores. In the fruits of this class, the style is the part
usually modified into a long plumose organ, possessing a high degree of mobility,
as in <em>Pulsatilla</em>, <em>Sieversia</em>, and <em>Clematis</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>7. Awned, ascospores. These are almost exclusively grasses, in which the
awns serve for distribution by wind, water, or animals, and even, according
to Kerner, by hygroscopic creeping movements. The mobility in many cases
is great.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. Spiny, centrospores. This group contains a few representatives which
possess a moderate degree of mobility by attachment, as in <em>Tribulus</em> and
<em>Cenchrus</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. Hooked, oncospores. The members of this group are extremely numerous,
and the degree of mobility as a rule is very high. All exhibit in common
the development of hooks or barbs, by which they are disseminated in
consequence of attachment, though the number, size, and disposition of the
hooks vary exceedingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. Viscid, gloeospores. In these, the inflorescence is more or less covered
with a viscid substance, as in species of <em>Silene</em>, or the fruit is beset with
glandular hairs, as in <em>Cerastium</em>, <em>Salvia</em>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>11. Fleshy, sarcospores. These are intended for dissemination by deglutition,
largely by birds; the effectiveness of the modification depends in a
large degree upon the resistance of the seed envelope to digestion. The
mobility varies greatly, but the area over which migration may be effected is
large.</p>

<p class='c007'>12. Nut-fruited, creatospores. This group includes those plants with nut
fruits which are carried away and secreted by animals for food.</p>

<p class='c007'>13. Flagellate, mastigospores. These are plants with ciliate or flagellate
propagative cells, i. e., zoogonidia, as in <em>Protococcus</em>, <em>Ulothrix</em>, <em>Oedogonium</em>,
<em>Ectocarpus</em>, etc., or with plant bodies similarly motile, <em>Bacteriaceae</em> and
<em>Volvocaceae</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>265. Position of disseminule.</b> The position on the plant of the organ to
be disseminated, i. e., its exposure to the distributing agent, plays a considerable
part in determining the degree of mobility. In the majority of plants,
the position of the inflorescence itself results in maximum exposure, but in a
large number of forms special modifications have been developed for placing
the spores or seeds in a more favorable position. In both cases, there are
often present also devices for bringing about the abscission of the seed or
fruit. It is, moreover, self-evident that the height of the inflorescence above
ground or above the surrounding vegetation is likewise of considerable importance
in increasing the trajectory. It is yet too early to make a complete
classification of contrivances for placing disseminules in the most favorable
exposure, but the following will serve as a basis for future arrangements.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. In all operculate <em>Discomycetes</em>, and especially in the <em>Ascobolaceae</em>,
where the asci project above the hymenium, the spores are raised above the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>surface by tensions within the apothecium. This might be regarded as dissemination
by expulsion, if it were not for the fact that the spores fall back
into the cup, unless carried away by the wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. In <em>Gasteromycetes</em> and in certain <em>Hepaticae</em>, the spores are not only
elevated slightly above the sporophore by the expanding capillitium or by
the mass of elaters, but they are also held apart in such a way that the wind
blows them out much more readily.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. In <em>Bryophyta</em>, the sporophore regularly dehisces by a slit, or is provided
with a peristome. Both structures are for the purpose of sifting the
spores out into the wind; by reason of their hygroscopicity, they also insure
that the spores will not be shaken out in wet weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. In a few grasses, such as <em>Stipa</em> and <em>Aristida</em>, the twisting and intertwining
of the awns lift the floret out of the glumes, and at the same time
constitute a contrivance readily blown away by the wind or carried by
attachment.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. In certain <em>Compositae</em>, the involucral scales are reflexed at maturity,
and at the same time the disk becomes more or less convex, serving to loosen
the achenes. This result is also secured in certain species by the drying and
spreading of the pappus hairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. The scapose <em>Liguliflorae</em>, <em>Taraxacum</em>, <em>Agoseris</em>, etc., are characterized
by the elongation of the scape after anthesis, with the result that the head is
raised to a considerable height by the time the achenes are mature.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Carpotropic movements, though primarily for another purpose, often
serve to bring seeds and fruits into a better position for dissemination.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>266. Seed production.</b> The relation of spore or seed-production to mobility
is obvious in the case of mobile species; in the case of immobile ones, it
is just as evident that it has no effect, though it may still have considerable
influence in increasing migration. In the case of two species with equally
effective dissemination contrivances, the one with the largest seed-production
will be the more mobile. On the basis of the relation of seeds to flower, two
groups of plants may be distinguished, one, <em>Polyanthae</em>, in which the flowers
are many and the seeds few or single, as in <em>Compositae</em>, and the other, <em>Polyspermatae</em>,
<em>Portulaca</em>, <em>Yucca</em>, etc., in which the number of seeds to each
flower is large. So far as the actual number of seeds produced is concerned,
polyanthous plants may not differ from polyspermatous ones, but, as a rule,
they are much more highly specialized for dissemination and are more mobile.
The number of fertile seeds is also much greater, a fact which is of
great importance in ecesis, and which, taken in connection with mobility,
partially explains the supremacy of the composites. Among the fungi and
algae, the amount of spore-production in a large degree determines the mobility,
since these forms are intrinsically permobile.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span><b>267. Agents of migration.</b> In the last analysis, however, the possibility of
migration depends upon the action of distributive agents; in the absence of
these, even the most perfect contrivance is valueless, while their presence
brings about the distribution of the most immobile form. In short, migration
depends much more upon such agents than upon mobility, however perfect
the latter may be. It is, moreover, evident that the amount and extent
of migration will be determined primarily by the permanence and forcefulness
of the agent, as indicated by its ability to bring about transportation.
Finally, as will be shown later, the direction and rapidity of migration depend
directly upon the direction and intensity of the agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Migration results when spores, seeds, fruits, offshoots, or plants are moved
out of their home by water, wind, animals, man, gravity, glaciers, growth, or
mechanical propulsion. Corresponding to these agents, there may be recognized
the following groups:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Water, hydrochores. These comprise all plants distributed exclusively
by water, whether the latter acts as ocean currents, tides, streams, or surface
run-off. In the case of streams and run-off, especially, mobility plays little
part, provided the disseminules are impervious or little subject to injury by
water. Motile plants, or those with motile cells, which belong entirely to
this group, may be distinguished as autochores, which correspond closely to
mastigospores.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Wind, anemochores. This group includes the majority of all permobile
terrestrial plants, i. e., those in which modifications for increasing surface
have been carried to the extreme, or those which are already permobile
by reason of the minuteness of the spore or seed. Saccate, winged, comate,
parachute, pappose, plumed, and, to a certain extent, awned seeds and fruits
represent the various types of modifications for wind-distribution.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Animals, zoochores. Among terrestrial plants, dissemination by attachment
represents essentially the same degree of specialization as is found
in wind-distributed plants. The three types of contrivances for this purpose
are found in spinose, hooked, and glandular fruits. Dissemination by
deglutition and by carriage, either intentional or unintentional, though of
less value, play a striking part on account of the great distance to which
the seeds may be carried. Dissemination by deglutition is characteristic
of sarcospores, and distribution by carriage of creatospores.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Man, brotochores. Dissemination by man has practically no connection
with mobility. It operates through great distances and over immense
areas as well as near at hand. It may be intentional, as in the case of
cultivated species, or unintentional, as in thousands of native or exotic
species. No other disseminating agent is comparable with man in respect
to universal and obvious migration.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>5. Gravity, clitochores. The members of this group are exclusively colline,
montane, and alpine plants, growing on rocks, cliffs, and gravel slides
(talus), etc., in which the seeds reach lower positions merely by falling, or
more frequently by the breaking away and rolling down of rock or soil
masses and particles. Dissemination by this method is relatively insignificant,
though it plays an important part in the rock fields and gravel slides
of mountain regions, particularly in the case of immobile species.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Glaciers, crystallochores. At the present time, transport by glaciers
is of slight importance, because of the restriction of the latter to alpine and
polar regions, where the flora is poorly developed. In the consideration
of migrations during the glacial epoch, however, it plays an important point.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Growth, blastochores. The mobility of species disseminated by offshoots
is extremely slight, and the annual movement relatively insignificant.
The certainty of migration and of ecesis, is, however, so great, and the
presence of offshoots so generally the rule in terrestrial plants that growth
plays an important part in migration, especially within formations.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. Propulsion, bolochores. Like growth, dissemination by mechanical
propulsion, though operating through insignificant distances, exerts an important
effect in consequence of its cumulative action. The number of
plants, however, with contrivances for propulsion is very much smaller than
the number of blastochores. All bolochorous species agree in having modifications
by means of which a tension is established. At maturity, this
tension suddenly overcomes the resistance of sporangium or fruit, and
throws the enclosed spores or seeds to some distance from the parent plant.
In accordance with the manner in which the tension is produced, sling-fruits
may be classified as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>a</em>) Hygroscopicity, pladoboles. These include the ferns with annulate
sporangia, in which the expansion of the annulus by the absorption of moisture
bursts the sporangium more or less suddenly, though the actual propulsion
of the spores seems to come later as a result of dessication.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>b</em>) Turgescence, edoboles. Dissemination by turgescence is highly
developed in <em>Pilobolus</em> and in <em>Discomycetes</em>, though in the latter turgescence
results rather in placing the spores in a position to be readily carried by
the wind. <em>Impatiens</em> and <em>Oxalis</em> furnish familiar examples of fruits which
dehisce in consequence of increased turgidity.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>c</em>) Dessication, xerioboles. The number of fruits which dehisce upon
drying is very large, but only a small portion of these expel their seeds
forcibly. <em>Geranium</em>, <em>Viola</em>, <em>Erysimum</em>, and <em>Lotus</em> illustrate the different
ways in which dessication effects the sudden splitting of fruits.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>d</em>) Resilience, tonoboles. In some plants, especially composites, labiates,
and borages, the achenes or nutlets are so placed in the persistent calyx or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>involucre that the latter serves as a sort of mortar for projection, when the
stem of the plant is bent to one side by any force, such as the wind or an
animal. It will be noticed that two separate agents are actually concerned in
dissemination of this sort.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frequently, two or more agents will act upon the same disseminule,
usually in succession. The possibility of such combinations in nature is
large, but actual cases seem to be infrequent, except where the activities of
man enter into the question. Some parts, moreover, such as awned inflorescences,
are carried almost equally well by wind or animals, and may often
be disseminated by the cooperation of these two agents. The wind also
often blows seeds and fruits into streams by which they are carried away,
but here again, parts adapted to wind-dissemination are injured as a rule
by immersion in water, and the number of plants capable of being scattered
by the successive action of wind and water is small.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present state of our knowledge of migration, it is impossible to
establish any definite correspondence between dissemination-contrivance,
agent, and habitat. As a general rule, plants growing in or near the water,
in so far as they are modified for this purpose at all, are adapted to water-carriage.
Species which grow in exposed grassy or barren habitats are for
the most part anemochores, while those that are found in the shelter of
forests and thickets are usually zoochorous, though the taller trees and
shrubs, being exposed to the upper air currents, are generally wind-distributed.
There is then a fair degree of correspondence, inasmuch as most
hydrophytes are hydrochorous, most hylophytes, zoochorous, and the majority
of poophytes and xerophytes, anemochorous. Definite conclusions
can be reached, however, only by the statistical study of representative
formations.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to their activity, agents may be distinguished as constant,
as in the case of currents, streams, winds, slope, growth, and propulsion,
or intermittent, animals and man. In the former, the direction is more or
less determinate, and migration takes place year by year, i. e., it is continuous,
while in the latter dissemination is largely an accidental affair, indeterminate
in direction, and recurring only at indefinite intervals. The
effective conversion of migration into invasion is greatest when the movement
is continuous, and least when it is discontinuous, since, in the latter,
species are usually carried not only out of their particular habitat but even
far beyond their geographical area, and the migration, instead of being
an annual one with the possibility of gradual adjustment, may not recur for
several years, or may, indeed, never take place again. The rapidity of
migration is greatest in the case of intermittent agents, while the distance
of migration is variable, being great chiefly in the case of man, ocean currents,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>and wind, and slight when the movement is due to slope, growth, or
propulsion. Disregarding the great distances over which artificial transport
may operate, seeds may be carried half way across the continent in a
week by strong-flying birds, while the possibilities of migration by growth
or expulsion are limited to a few inches, or at most to a few feet per year.
This slowness, however, is more than counterbalanced by the enormously
greater number of disseminules, and their much greater chance of becoming
established.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>268. The direction of migration</b> is determinate, except in the case
of those distributive agents which act constantly in the same direction.
The general tendency is, of course, forward, the lines of movement radiating
in all directions from the parent area. This is well illustrated by the operation
of winds which blow from any quarter. In the case of the constant
winds, migration takes a more or less definite direction, the latter being
determined to a large degree by the fruiting period of any particular species.
In this connection, it must be kept clearly in mind that the position of new
areas with reference to the original home of a species does not necessarily
indicate the direction of migration, as the disseminules may have been
carried to numerous other places in which ecesis was impossible. The local
distribution of zoochorous species is of necessity indeterminate, though
distant migration follows the pathways of migratory birds and animals. In
so far as dissemination by man takes place along great commercial routes,
or along highways, it is determinate. In ponds, lakes, and other bodies of
standing water, migration may occur in all directions, but in ocean currents,
streams, etc., the movement is determinate, except in the case of motile
species. The dissemination of plants by slopes, glaciers, etc., is local and
definite, while propulsion is in the highest degree indeterminate. Migration
by growth is equally indefinite, with the exception that hydrotropism and
chemotropism result in a radiate movement away from the mass, while
propulsion throws seeds indifferently into or away from the species-mass.
From the above it will be seen that distant migration may take place by
means of water, wind, animals or man, and, since all these agents act in
a more or less definite direction over great distances, that it will be in
some degree determinate. On the other hand, local migration will as
regularly be indeterminate, except in the case of streams and slopes. The
direction of migration, then, is controlled by these distributive agents, and
the limit of migration is determined by the intensity and duration of the
agent, as well as by the character of the space through which the latter
operates.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>
  <h4 class='c018'><em>ECESIS</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>269. Concept.</b> By the term ecesis is designated the series of phenomena
exhibited by an invading disseminule from the time it enters a new formation
until it becomes thoroughly established there. In a word, ecesis is
the adjustment of a plant to a new habitat. It comprises the whole process
covered more or less incompletely by acclimatization, naturalization, accommodation,
etc. It is the decisive factor in invasion, inasmuch as migration
is entirely ineffective without it, and is of great value in indicating the
presence and direction of migration in a great number of species where
the disseminule is too minute to be detected or too little specialized to be
recognizable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The relation of migration to ecesis is a most intimate one: the latter
depends in a large measure upon the time, direction, rapidity, distance, and
amount of migration. In addition, there is an essential alternation between
the two, inasmuch as migration is followed by ecesis, and the latter then
establishes a new center from which further migration is possible, and so on.
The time of year in which fruits mature and distributive agents act has a
marked influence upon the establishment of a species. Disseminules designed
to pass through a resting period are often brought into conditions where
they germinate at once, and in which they perish because of unfavorable
physical factors, or because competing species are too far advanced. On
the other hand, spores and propagules designed for immediate germination
may be scattered abroad at a time when conditions make growth impossible.
The direction of movement is decisive in that the seed or spore is carried
into a habitat sufficiently like that of the parent to secure establishment,
or into one so dissimilar that germination is impossible, or at least is not
followed by growth and reproduction. The rapidity and distance of migration
have little influence, except upon the less resistant disseminules, conidia,
gemmae, etc. Finally, the amount of migration, i. e., the number of migrants,
is of the very greatest importance, affecting directly the chances
that vigorous disseminules will be carried into places where ecesis is possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Normally, ecesis consists of three essential processes, germination, growth,
and reproduction. This is the rule among terrestrial plants, in which migration
regularly takes place by means of a resting part. In free aquatic
forms, however, the growing plant or part is usually disseminated, and
ecesis consists merely in being able to continue growth and to insure reproduction.
Here establishment is practically certain, on account of the
slight differences in aquatic habitats, excepting of course the extremes, fresh
water and salt water. The ease indeed with which migration and ecesis are
effected in the water often makes it impossible to speak properly of invasion
in this connection, since aquatics are to such a large extent cosmopolitan.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>In dissemination by offshoots, the conditions are somewhat similar. Here,
also, ecesis comprises the sequence of growth and reproduction, and invasion,
in the sense of passing from one habitat to another, is of rare
occurrence, as the offshoot grows regularly under the same conditions as
the parent plant. The adjustment of growing plants and parts is so slight,
and their establishment so certain on account of their inability to migrate
into very remote or different habitats, that they may be ignored in the following
discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In accordance with the above, it would be possible to distinguish three
groups of terrestrial plants: (1) those migrants which germinate and disappear,
(2) those which germinate and grow but never reproduce, (3)
those which reproduce, either by propagation or generation, or both. Such
a classification has little value, however, since the same species may behave
in all three fashions, depending upon the habitat to which it has migrated,
and since invasion does not occur unless the plant actually takes possession,
i. e., reproduces. From the latter statement, it follows that invasion occurs
only when a species migrates to a new place, in which it germinates, matures,
and reproduces. Maintenance by annual invasion simply, in which
the plants of each year disappear completely, can not then be regarded
as invasion proper. On the other hand, though such instances are rare, it
is not necessary that the invaders produce fruit, provided they are able to
maintain themselves, or to increase by propagation. Furthermore, if a plant
germinate, grow, and reproduce, it is relatively immaterial whether it persist
for a few years or for many, since, as we shall see under Succession,
the plants of one invasion are displaced by those of the next, the interval
between invasions increasing with the stabilization.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>270. Germination of the seed.</b> The germination of seed or spore
is determined by its viability and by the nature of the habitat. Viability
depends upon the structural characters of fruit, seed-coat, and endosperm,
and to a degree upon the nature of the protoplasm or embryo. The first
three affect the last directly, by protecting the embryo against dryness,
against injury due to carriage by water, or by deglutition, and probably in
some cases against excessive heat or cold. Marloth<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c017'><sup>[33]</sup></a> has investigated the
structure of seed coats, establishing the following groups, which are summarized
here somewhat fully because of their bearing upon ecesis: (1)
seed coats without protective elements, endosperm absent or rudimentary,
<em>Epilobium</em>, <em>Impatiens</em>, <em>Parnassia</em>, <em>Sagittaria</em>, etc.; (2) protective elements
lacking or few, endosperm highly developed with thick-walled cells,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span><em>Liliaceae</em>, <em>Primulaceae</em>, <em>Rubiaceae</em>, etc.; (3) protective cells present in the
seed coats, endosperm little or none, <em>Boraginaceae</em>, <em>Crassulaceae</em>, <em>Cruciferae</em>,
<em>Labiatae</em>, <em>Papilionaceae</em>, etc.; (4) protective elements present, <em>Asclepias</em>,
<em>Campanula</em>, <em>Gentiana</em>, <em>Silene</em>, <em>Saxifraga</em>, etc.; (5) protective cells present,
endosperm thick-walled, <em>Euonymus</em>, <em>Helianthemum</em>, <em>Ribes</em>. The protective
cells are of various kinds: (1) epidermal cells strongly cuticularized,
<em>Caryophyllaceae</em>, <em>Crassulaceae</em>, <em>Fumariaceae</em>, <em>Saxifragaceae</em>; (2) parenchyma
thick-walled, several-layered, <em>Aesculus</em>, <em>Castanea</em>, <em>Fagus</em>; (3)
parenchyma cells with the inner or radial walls thickened, <em>Campanula</em>,
<em>Erythraea</em>, <em>Gentiana</em>; (4) epidermal cells cup-shaped, thick-walled, <em>Cruciferae</em>,
<em>Ribes</em>, <em>Vaccinium</em>; (5) parenchyma with thickened, cellulose walls,
<em>Geranium</em>, <em>Viburnum</em>; (6) a single row of stone-cells, <em>Labiatae</em>; (7) tissue
of stone-cells, <em>Hippuris</em>, <em>Naias</em>, <em>Potamogeton</em>; (8) elongate stone-cells,
<em>Coniferae</em>, <em>Cupuliferae</em>, <em>Euphorbia</em>, <em>Linum</em>, <em>Malva</em>, <em>Viola</em>; (9) short, columnar,
thick-walled branched cells, <em>Cucurbitaceae</em>, <em>Datura</em>, <em>Hypericum</em>; (10)
prosenchyma with cellulose walls, <em>Clematis</em>; (11) prosenchyma with lignified
walls, <em>Fraxinus</em>, <em>Rhamnus</em>, <em>Ranunculus</em>. The seed coats have a certain influence
in determining germination at the proper time, inasmuch as they
make it difficult for the seed to germinate under the stimulus of a quantity
of warmth and moisture insufficient to support the seedling. The effect of
the endosperm, as well as that of other food supply in the seed, upon
germination and the establishment of the seedling is obvious.</p>

<p class='c007'>The behavior of seed or spore with respect to germination depends in
a large degree upon the character of the protoplasm or embryo, though in
just what way is at present a matter of conjecture. It is evident that many
seeds are not viable because fertilization has not been effected, and in consequence
no embryo has developed. This is the usual explanation of the
low germinating power of the seeds of some species, especially polyspermatous
ones. But even in viable seeds the behavior is always more or less
irregular. The seeds of some species will grow immediately after ripening,
while others germinate only after a resting period of uncertain duration.
The same is true of spores. Even in the case of seeds from the same
parent, under apparently similar conditions, while the majority will germinate
the first year, some will lie dormant for one or more years. The
precise reason why many seeds and spores germinate more readily after
being frozen is equally obscure. The period of time for which disseminules
may remain viable is extremely diverse, though, as would be expected, it
is much longer as a rule for seeds than for spores. The greater vitality of
seeds in the case of ruderal plants suggests that this diversity may be due
simply to variation in the vigor of the embryos. It would seem that under
proper conditions seeds may retain their viability for an indefinite period.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>The influence of habitat upon germination is of primary importance,
though the manner in which its influence is exerted is by no means as
evident as might be supposed. In the case of seeds sown in the planthouse,
it is almost universally the case that germination is less than in nature,
notwithstanding the fact that temperature and moisture appear to be
optimum. In nature, the seeds of the species may be carried into a number
of different formations, any one or all of which may present conditions unfavorable
to germination. With respect to probability of germination,
habitats are of two sorts: those which are denuded and those which bear
vegetation. It is impossible to lay down general propositions with respect
to either group, since germination will vary with the character of the invading
species, the annual distribution of heat and moisture in the habitat,
etc. In a general way, however, it may be stated that the chances for
germination are greater in vegetation than in denuded areas, chiefly because
the latter are usually xerophytic. On the other hand, the lack of competition
in the denuded area tends to make ultimate establishment much more
certain. Here, as elsewhere when exact statistical results are desired, the
use of the quadrat, and especially of the permanent quadrat, is necessary
to determine the comparative germination of the invading species in relation
to denudation and vegetation.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>271. Adjustment to the habitat.</b> The seedling once established by
germination, the probability of its growing and maturing will depend upon
its habitat form, plasticity, and vegetation form. Even though it may
germinate under opposite conditions, a typical hylophyte, such as Impatiens
for example, will not thrive in an open meadow, nor will characteristic
poophytes, such as most grasses, grow in deep shade. In the same way,
xerophytes do not adapt themselves to hydrophytic habitats, nor hydrophytes
to xerophytic conditions. Many mesophytes, however, possess to a certain
degree the ability to adjust themselves to somewhat xerophytic or hydrophytic
situations, while woodland plants often invade either forest or
meadow. This capability for adjustment, i. e., plasticity, is greatest in intermediate
species, those that grow in habitats not characterized by great
excess or deficiency of some factor, and it is least in forms highly specialized
in respect to water-content, shade, etc. It may then be established as a
fundamental rule that ecesis is determined very largely by the essential physical
similarity of the old and the new habitat, except in the case of plastic
forms, which admit of a wider range of accommodation. The plasticity of
a plant is not necessarily indicated by structural modification, though such
adjustment is usually typical of plastic species, but it may sometimes arise
from a functional adaptation, which for some reason does not produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>concomitant structural changes. The former explains such various habitat
forms of the same species as are found in <em>Galium boreale</em>, <em>Gentiana acuta</em>,
etc., and the latter the morphological constancy of plants like <em>Chamaenerium</em>,
which grow in very diverse habitats.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vegetation form of the invading species is often of the greatest importance
in determining whether it will become established. The vegetation
form represents those modifications which, produced in the original home
by competition, i. e., the struggle for existence, are primarily of value in
securing and maintaining a foothold. These comprise all structures by
means of which the plant occupies a definite space in the air, through which
the necessary light and heat reach it, and in the soil, from which it draws
its food supply. These structures are all organs of duration or of perennation,
such as root, rootstalk, bulb, tuber, woody stem, etc., which find their
greatest development among trees and shrubs, and their least among annual
herbs. But while the invaders are aided in securing possession by the proper
vegetation form, the occupation of the plant already in possession is increased
by the same means, and the outcome is then largely determined by
other factors. To avoid repetition, the bearing of occupation upon invasion
will be considered under succession.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>BARRIERS</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>272. Concept.</b> DeCandolle<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c017'><sup>[34]</sup></a> seems to have been the first to use the term
barrier and to distinguish the various kinds, though Hedenberg<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c017'><sup>[35]</sup></a> clearly saw
that stations of one kind were insurmountable obstacles to plants belonging
to a very different type. De Candolle pointed out that the natural barriers
to continuous invasion (“transport de proche en proche”) are: (1) seas,
which decrease invasion almost in inverse proportion to their extent; (2)
deserts; (3) mountain ranges, which are less absolute on account of passes,
valleys, etc.; (4) vegetation, marshes being barriers to dry land plants,
forests to those that fear the shade, etc. Grisebach<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c017'><sup>[36]</sup></a>, in discussing the effect
of barriers upon the constitution of vegetation, laid down the fundamental
rule that: “The supreme law which serves as the basis of the permanent
establishment of natural floras is to be recognized in the barriers which have
hindered or completely prevented invasion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Any feature of the topography, whether physical or biological, that restricts
or prevents invasion, is a barrier. Such features are usually permanent
and produce permanent barriers, though the latter may often be
temporary, existing for a few years only, or even for a single season. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>this last case, however, they are as a rule recurrent. Barriers may furthermore
be distinguished as complete or incomplete with respect to the
thoroughness with which they limit invasion. Finally, the consideration of
this subject gains clearness if it be recognized that there are barriers to
migration as well as to ecesis, and if we distinguish barriers as physical or
biological with reference to the character of the feature concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>273. Physical barriers</b> are those in which limitation is produced by
some marked physiographic feature, such as the ocean or some other large
body of water, large rivers, mountain ranges and deserts (including ice
and snow fields). All of these are effective by virtue of their dominant
physical factors; hence they are barriers to the ecesis of species coming from
very different habitats, but they act as conductors for species from similar
vegetation, especially in the case of water currents. A body of water, representing
maximum water-content, is a barrier to mesophytic and xerophytic
species, but a conductor for hydrophytic ones; deserts set a limit to the
spread of mesophytic and hydrophytic plants, while they offer conditions
favorable to the invasion of xerophytes; and a high mountain range, because
of the reduction of temperature, restricts the extension of macrothermal
and mesothermal plants. A mountain range, unlike other physical
barriers, is also an obstacle to migration, inasmuch as natural distributive
agents rarely act through it or over it.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>274. Biological barriers</b> include vegetation, man and animals, and plant
parasites. The limiting effect of vegetation is exhibited in two ways.
In the first place, a formation acts as a barrier to the ecesis of species invading
it from the formations of another type, on account of the physical
differences of the habitats. Whether such a barrier be complete or partial
will depend upon the degree of dissimilarity existing between the formations.
Hylophytes are unable to invade a prairie, though open thicket plants
may do so to a certain degree. In the same way, a forest formation on
account of its diffuse light is a barrier to poophytes; and a swamp, because
of the amount and character of the water-content, sets a limit to both
hylophytes and poophytes. Formations, such as forests, thickets, etc.,
sometimes act also as direct obstacles to migration, as in the case of tumbleweeds
and other anemochores, clitochores, etc. A marked effect of vegetation
in decreasing invasion arises from the closed association typical of
stable formations and of social exclusive species. In these, the occupation
is so thorough and the struggle for existence so intense that the invaders,
though fitted to grow under the physical factors present, are unable to compete
with the species in possession for the requisite amount of some necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>factor. Closed associations usually act as complete barriers, while open
ones restrict invasion in direct proportion to the degree of occupation. To
this fact may be traced a fundamental law of succession, viz., the number
of stages in a succession is determined largely by the increasing difficulty
of invasion as the habitat becomes stabilized. Man and animals affect migration
directly, though not obviously, by the destruction of disseminules.
They operate as a pronounced barrier to ecesis wherever they alter conditions
in such a way as to make them unfavorable to invading species, or
when, by direct action upon the latter, such as grazing, tramping, parasitism,
etc., they turn the scale in the struggle for existence. The absence of
insects adapted to insure fertilization is sometimes a serious barrier to the
establishment of adventitious or introduced plants. The presence of parasitic
fungi, in so far as they destroy the seeds of plants, acts as an obstacle
to migration, and restricts or prevents ecesis in so far as the fungi destroy
the invaders, or place them at a disadvantage in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>275. Influence of barriers.</b> Physical barriers are typically permanent in
character, while biological ones are either permanent or temporary, depending
upon the permanence of the formation and the constancy of the physical
factors which determine it. A stable formation, such as a forest or meadow,
which acts as a decided barrier to invasion from adjacent vegetation, may
disappear completely, as a result of a landslide, flood, or burn, or through
the activity of man, and may leave an area into which invaders crowd from
every point. Often, without undergoing marked change, a formation which
has presented conditions unfavorable to the ecesis of species of mesophytic
character may, by reason of a temporary change in climate, become sufficiently
modified to permit the invasion of mesophytes. On the other hand,
a meadow ceases to be a barrier to prairie xerophytes during a period of
unusually dry years. A peculiar example of the modification of a barrier is
afforded by the defoliation of aspen forests in the mountains as a result of
which poophytes have been enabled to invade them. Nearly all xerophytic
stretches of sand and gravel, dunes, blowouts, gravel slides, etc., and even
prairies to a certain degree, exhibit a recurrent seasonal change in spring,
as a result of which the hot, dry surface becomes sufficiently moist to permit
the germination and growth of invaders, which are entirely barred out
during the remainder of the year. In an absolute sense, no barrier is complete,
since the coldest as well as the driest portions of the earth’s surface
are capable, at times at least, of supporting the lowest types of vegetation.
Relatively, however, in connection with the natural spread of terrestrial
plants, it is possible to distinguish partial barriers from complete ones.
Such a distinction is of importance in the consideration of invasions from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>a definite region, as it is only in this restricted sense that complete barriers
have produced endemism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Distance, though hardly to be considered a barrier in the strict sense of
the word, unquestionably plays an important part in determining the amount
of invasion. The effect of distance is best seen in the case of migration, as
it influences ecesis only in those rare cases where viability is affected. The
importance of distance, or take the converse, of proximity, is readily ascertained
by the study of any succession from denudation. It has been established
that the contiguous vegetation furnishes 75–90 per cent of the
constituent species of the initial formation, and in mountainous regions,
where ruderal plants are extremely rare, the percentage is even higher. The
reason for this is to be found not only in the fact that the adjacent species
have a much shorter distance to go, and hence will be carried in much
greater quantity, but also in that the species of the formations beyond must
pass through or over the adjacent ones. In the latter case, the number of
disseminules is relatively small on account of the distance, while invasion
through the intermediate vegetation, if not entirely impossible, is extremely
slow, so that plants coming in by this route reach the denuded area only
to find it already occupied. It is as yet impossible to give a definite numerical
value to proximity in the various invasions that mark any particular
succession. This will not be feasible until a satisfactory method has been
found for determining a coefficient of mobility, but, this once done, it will
be a relatively simple matter, not merely to trace the exact evolution of any
succession of formations, but actually to ascertain from the adjacent vegetation
the probable constitution of a particular future stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>From what has been said, it follows that the primary effect of barriers
upon vegetation is obstruction. Where the barrier is in the pathway of
migration, however, it causes deflection of the migrant as a rule, and sets
up migration in a new direction. This is often the case when the strong
winds of the plains carry disseminules towards the mountains and, being
unable to cross the range, drop them at the base, or, being deflected, carry
them away at right angles to the original direction. The same thing happens
when resistant fruits and seeds borne by the wind fall into streams of water
or into ocean currents. The direction of migration is changed, and what is
normally a barrier serves as an agent of dissemination.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>ENDEMISM</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>276. Concept.</b> Since its first use by DeCandolle, the term endemic has
been employed quite consistently by phytogeographers with the meaning
of “peculiar to a certain region.” Some confusion, however, has arisen
from the fact that a few authors have made it more or less synonymous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>with indigenous and autochthonous, while others have regarded it as an
antonym of exotic. In its proper sense, endemic refers to distribution, and
not to origin. Its exact opposite will be found then in Fenzl’s term polydemic,
dwelling in several regions. Indigenous (autochthonous) and exotic,
on the contrary, denote origin, and are antonyms, indigenous signifying
native, and exotic foreign. As Drude has shown, endemic plants may be
either indigenous, as in the case of those species that have never moved out
of the original habitat, or exotic, as in the much rarer instances where a
polydemic species has disappeared from its original home and from all
regions into which it has migrated except one. It is understood that not
all indigenous or exotic species are endemic. The proportion of endemic to
polydemic species is a variable and somewhat artificial one, depending upon
the size of the divisions employed.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>277. Causes.</b> The primary causes of endemism are two, lack of migration
and presence of barriers. Since distributive agents are practically
universal, lack of migration corresponds essentially to immobility, a fact
which decreases the difficulty of ascertaining the immediate causes of
endemism in any particular species. Either immobility or a barrier may
produce endemism; extremely immobile plants, for example, liliaceous
species propagating almost wholly by underground parts, are as a rule
endemic, while alpine plants and those of oceanic islands are endemic in
the highest degree, regardless of their mobility. When the two conditions
act concomitantly upon a species, endemism is almost inevitable. It can not
be supposed, however, that immobility or natural barriers alone, or the
concomitance of the two, must invariably give rise to endemic species; the
most immobile plant may be carried into another region by unusual or
accidental agencies, or the most formidable barrier to migration may be
overcome by the intensity of an agent or through the action of man. Endemism
is also brought about by the modification of species; new or
nascent species are as a rule endemic. Whether they will remain endemic
or not will depend upon the perfection of their contrivances for dissemination
and upon the presence of barriers to migration or ecesis. Finally, as
Drude was the first to point out, the disappearance of a polydemic species in
all regions but one, owing to the struggle for existence or to changed
physical conditions, will result in endemism.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>278. Significance.</b> Endemism is readily recognized by methods of
distributional statistics, applied to areas limited by natural barriers to
migration or ecesis. For political areas, it has no significance whatever,
unless the boundaries of these coincide with barriers. It determines in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>first degree the validity of regions, though the latter are often recognized
also by the presence of barriers and by the character of the vegetation.
Endemism may occur in areas of vegetation of any rank from a formation
to a zone. When the term is not qualified, however, it should be used of
species with reference to formations alone. Comparisons to be of value,
however, can be instituted only between areas of the same order, i. e., between
two or more formations, two or more regions, provinces, etc. In the
same way, taxonomic groups of the same rank should be used in such comparisons,
i. e., species should be contrasted with species, genera with genera,
and families with families, except when it is desired to obtain some measure
of the age of the vegetation by the differentiation of the endemic phyla
within it. There will be seen to exist a fundamental correspondence between
the rank of the floral division and the taxonomic group, though the apparent
exceptions to this are still too numerous to warrant its expression in a
general law. As a rule, however, formations most frequently show endemic
habitat forms and species, more rarely endemic genera; regions and provinces
commonly exhibit endemic species and genera, rarely endemic families;
while zones and hemispheres contain endemic orders as well as families.
This correspondence is readily seen to depend primarily upon the fact that
increased differentiation in the taxonomic sense is a concomitant of the increased
invasion of endemic species, measured in terms of distance and difference
in habitat.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is too early to decide satisfactorily whether it is proper to speak of
formations as endemic. At first thought it would seem that all formations,
with the exception of ruderal ones, were endemic, but a study of almost
any transition area between regions would seem to point to the opposite conclusion,
viz., that no formations are properly endemic. It is equally
impossible at present to distinguish different types of endemics, such as
relictae, etc., as any such classification must await the elaboration of a method
for determining the phylogeny of a natural group of species by an investigation
of their comparative differentiation in connection with their migration
in all directions from the vegetation center into new habitats. In short, it
will not be possible to make a thorough study of endemism and to postulate
its laws until modern methods of research have been extended to a much
larger portion of the vegetation of the globe. The final task of phytogeography
is the division of the earth’s vegetation into natural areas. It will
be at once evident that most plants can not properly be called endemic until
the natural regions in which they are found have been accurately defined,
a work which has barely begun. In the much simpler matter of distribution,
upon which the accuracy of statistical methods depends directly, there are
few regions sufficiently well known at the present time to yield anything
like permanent results.</p>

  <h4 class='c018'><em>POLYPHYLESIS AND POLYGENESIS</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'><b>279. Concept.</b> The idea of polyphylesis, as advanced by Engler, contains
two distinct concepts: (1) that a species may arise in two different
places or at two different times from the same species, and (2) that a genus
or higher group may arise at different places or times by the convergence
of two or more lines of origin. It is here proposed to restrict polyphylesis,
as its meaning would indicate, to the second concept, and to employ for
the first the term polygenesis,<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c017'><sup>[37]</sup></a> first suggested by Huxley in the sense of
polyphylesis. The term polyphylesis is extended, however, to cover the
origin of those species which arise at different places or times from the
convergence of two or more different species, a logical extension of the
idea underlying polyphyletic genera, though it may seem at first thought to
be absurd. Polygenesis may be formally defined as the origin of one species
from another species at two or more distinct places on the earth’s surface,
at the same time or at different times, or its origin in the same place at
different times. Polyphylesis, on the contrary, is the origin of one species
from two or more different species at different places, at the same time or at
different times. It is evident that what is true of species in this connection
will hold equally well of genera and higher groups. Opposed to polygenesis
is monogenesis, in which a species arises but once from another species; with
polyphylesis is to be contrasted monophylesis, in which the species arises
from a single other species. It will be noticed at once that these two concepts
are closely related. The following diagrams will serve to make the above
distinctions more evident:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_230.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>I. Polygenesis      II. Polyphylesis      III. Monogenesis (Monophylesis)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>In I, a species A, becomes scattered over a large area in a series of places,
<em>m</em>&#160;... <em>m<sup>n</sup></em>, with the same physical factors, in any or all of which may
arise the new species <em>a</em>. In II, a species with xerophytic tendency, <em>A</em>, and
one with mesophytic tendency, <em>B</em>, in the course of migration find themselves
respectively in a more mesophytic habitat, <em>m</em>, and a more xerophytic one, <em>x</em>,
in which either may give rise to the new form, <em>c</em>, which is more or less
intermediate between <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. In III, the method of origin is of the
simplest type, in which a species is modified directly into another one, or is
split up into several.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>280. Proofs of polygenesis.</b> In affirming the probability of a polygenetic
origin of species, there is no intention of asserting that all species originate
in this way. It seems evident that a very large number of species of restricted
range are certainly monogenetic, at least as far as origin in space
is concerned. It is possible that any species may arise at two or more distinct
times. Polygenesis can occur readily only in species of more or less extensive
area, in which recur instances of the same or similar habitat. The
relative frequence and importance of the two methods can hardly be conjectured
as yet, but origin by monogenesis would seem to be the rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>The arguments adduced by Engler in support of polygenesis are in
themselves conclusive, but the investigations of the past decade have brought
to light additional proofs, especially from the experimental side. In determining
the physical factors of prairie and mountain formations, and
especially by methods of experimental ecology, the author has found that
habitats are much less complex than they are ordinarily thought to be,
since water-content and humidity, and to a less degree light, constitute the
only factors which produce direct modification. In addition, it has been
ascertained that the minimum difference of water-content, humidity, or light,
necessary to produce a distinguishable morphological adjustment is much
greater than the unit differences recorded by the instruments. In short,
the differences of habitats, as ascertained by thermograph, psychrometer
and photometer, are much greater than their efficient differences, and, with
respect to their ability to produce modification, habitats fall into relatively
few categories. A striking illustration of this is seen in the superficially
very different habitats, desert, strand, alkali plain, alpine moor, and arctic
tundra, all of which are capable of producing the same type of xerophyte.
It follows from this that many more or less plastic species of extensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>geographical area will find themselves in similar or identical situations,
measured in terms of efficient differences, and will be modified in the
same way in two or more of these. In mountain regions, where interruption
of the surface and consequent alternation are great, the mutual invasion
of contiguous formations is of frequent occurrence, often resulting in
habitat forms. The spots in which these nascent species, such as <em>Galium
boreale hylocolum</em>, <em>Aster levis lochmocolus</em>, etc., are found, are often so
related to the area of the parent species as to demonstrate conclusively
that these forms are the result of polygenesis and not of migration. Naturally,
what is true of a small area will hold equally well of a large region,
and the recurrence of the same habitat form may be accepted as conclusive
proof of polygenesis. The most convincing evidences of multiple origin,
however, are to be found in what De Vries has called “mutations.” It
makes little difference whether we accept mutations in the exact sense of this
author, or regard them as forms characterized by latent variability. The
evidence is conclusive that the same form may arise in nature or in cultivation,
in Holland or in America, not merely once, but several or many times.
In the presence of such confirmation, it is unnecessary to accumulate proofs.
Polygenesis throws a new light upon many difficult problems of invasion
and distribution, and, as a working principle, admits of repeated tests in
the field. It obviates, moreover, the almost insuperable difficulties in the
way of explaining the distribution of many polygenetic species on the basis
of migration alone.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>281. Origin by polyphylesis.</b> In 1898, the author first advanced a tentative
hypothesis to the effect that a species homogeneous morphologically
may arise from two distinct though related species. During subsequent
years of formational study, the conviction has grown in regard to the probability
of such a method of origin. Since the appearance of Engler’s work,
a polyphyletic origin for certain genera has been very generally accepted
by botanists, but all have ignored the fact that the polyphylesis of genera
carries with it the admission of such origin for species, since the former
are merely groups of the latter. I can not, however, agree with Engler, that
polyphyletic genera, and hence species also, are necessarily unnatural. If
the convergence of the lines of polyphylesis has been great, resulting in
essential morphological harmony, the genus is a natural one, even though
the ancestral phyla may be recognizable. If, on the other hand, the convergence
is more or less imperfect, resulting in subgroups of species more
nearly related within the groups than between them, the genus can hardly
be termed natural. This condition may, however, prevail in a monophyletic
genus with manifest divergence and still not be an indication that it is
artificial.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Darwin<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c017'><sup>[38]</sup></a>, in speaking of convergence, has said: “If two species, belonging
to two distinct though allied genera, had both produced a large number
of new and divergent forms, it is conceivable that these might approach each
other so closely that they would have all to be classified under the same
genus; and thus the descendants of two distinct genera would converge
into one.” The application of this statement to species would at once show
the possibility of polyphylesis in the latter, and a further examination of
the matter will demonstrate its probability. It is perfectly evident that a
species may be split into two or more forms by varying the conditions, let
us say of water-content, and that the descendants of these forms may again
be changed into the parent type by reversing the process. This has, in
fact, been done experimentally. Since it is admittedly impossible to draw
any absolute line between forms, varieties, and species, it is at once clear that
two distinct though related species, especially if they are plastic, may
be caused to converge in such a way that the variants may constitute
a new and homogeneous species. This may be illustrated by a concrete
case at present under investigation. <em>Kuhnistera purpurea</em> differs from
<em>K. candida</em> in being smaller, in having fewer, smaller, and more narrow
leaflets, and a globoid spike of purple flowers in place of an elongated
one of white flowers; in a word, it is more xerophytic. This conclusion
is completely corroborated by its occurrence. On dozens of slopes
examined, <em>Kuhnistera purpurea</em> has never been found mingling with <em>K.
candida</em> on lower slopes, except where an accident of the surface has resulted
in a local decrease of water-content. The experiment as conducted is a
simple one, consisting merely in sowing seed of each in the zone of the
other, and in growing <em>K. purpurea</em> under controlled mesophytic conditions,
and <em>K. candida</em> under similarly measured xerophytic conditions in the planthouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the polyphyletic origin of species is in a fair way to be decided by
experiment, it receives support from several well-known phenomena. The
striking similarity in the plant body of families taxonomically so distinct as
the <em>Cactaceae</em>, <em>Stapeliaceae</em>, and <em>Euphorbiaceae</em>, or <em>Cyperaceae</em> and <em>Juncaceae</em>,
indicates that a vegetation form may be polyphyletic. On the other
hand, the local appearance of zygomorphy, of symphysis, and of aphanisis
in the floral types of phylogeneticallv distinct families is a proof of the
operation of convergence in reproductive characters. To be sure, the convergence
is never so great as to produce more than superficial similarity,
but this is because the groups are markedly different in so many fundamental
characters. The same tendency in closely related species would easily result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>in identity. As in the case of polygenesis, the relatively small number of
typically distinct habitats makes it clear that two different species of wide
distribution, bearing to each other the relations of xerophyte to mesophyte,
of hydrophyte to mesophyte, or of poophyte to hylophyte, might often find
themselves in reciprocal situations, with the result that they would give rise
to the same new form. The final proof of the polyphylesis of species is
afforded by the experiments of De Vries in mutation. De Vries found that
<em>Oenothera nanella</em> arose from <em>O. Lamarckiana</em>, <em>O. laevifolia</em>, and <em>O. scintillans</em>;
<em>Oenothera scintillans</em> arose from <em>O. lata</em> and <em>O. Lamarckiana</em>; <em>Oenothera
rubrinervis</em> from <em>O. Lamarckiana</em>, <em>O. laevifolia</em>, <em>O. lata</em>, <em>O. oblonga</em>,
<em>O. nanella</em>, and <em>O. scintillans</em>, etc. Whatever may be the rank assigned to
these mutations, whether form, variety, or species, there can be no question
of their polyphyletic origin, nor, in consequence of the connection of
mutations with variations through such inconstant forms as <em>O. scintillans</em>,
<em>O. elliptica</em>, and <em>O. sublinearis</em>, of the possibility of polyphylesis in any
two distinct though related species or genera.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>KINDS OF INVASION</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>282. Continuous and intermittent invasion.</b> With respect to the frequency
of migration, we may distinguish invasion as <em>continuous</em>, or
<em>intermittent</em>. Continuous invasion, which is indeed usually mutual, occurs
between contiguous formations of more or less similar character, in which
there is an annual movement from one into the other, and at the same time
a forward movement through each, resulting from the invaders established
the preceding year. By far the greater amount of invasion is of this sort,
as may<a id='t234'></a> readily be seen from the fact that migration varies inversely as the
distance, and ecesis may decrease even more rapidly than the distance
increases. The significant feature of continuous invasion is that an outpost
may be reinforced every year, thus making probable the establishment of new
outposts from this as a center, and the ultimate extension of the species
over a wide area. The comparatively short distance and the regular alternation
of migration and ecesis render invasion of this sort very effective.
An excellent illustration of this is seen in transition areas and regions, which
are due directly to continuous and usually to mutual invasion. Intermittent
invasion results commonly from distant carriage, though it may occur very
rarely between dissimilar adjacent formations, when a temporary swing in
the physical factors makes ecesis possible for a time. It is characterized by
the fact that the succession of factors which have brought about the invasion
is more or less accidental and may never recur. Intermittent invasion
is relatively rare, and from the small number of disseminules affected, it is
of little importance in modifying vegetation quantitatively. On the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>hand, since a species may often be carried far from its geographical area,
it is frequently of great significance in distribution.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>283. Complete and partial invasion.</b> When the movement of invaders
into a formation is so great that the original occupants are finally driven out,
the invasion may be termed <em>complete</em>. Such invasion is found regularly in
the case of many ruderal formations, and is typical of the later stages of
many successions. It is ordinarily the result of continuous invasion. If
the number of invaders is sufficiently small that they may be adopted into
the formation without radically changing the latter, the invasion is <em>partial</em>.
This is doubtless true of the greater number of invasions, though these are
regularly much less striking and important than instances of complete
invasion.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>284. Permanent and temporary invasion.</b> The permanence of invasion
depends upon the success attending ecesis, and upon the stability of the
formation. It has already been noticed that under certain conditions plants
may germinate and grow, and if they are perennials, even become established,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>and still ecesis be so imperfect that reproduction is impossible. Others may
find the conditions sufficiently favorable for propagation, but unfavorable
for the formation of flowers and fruits. Finally there are plants
which seem to be perfectly established for a few years, only to disappear
completely. The latter are examples of <em>temporary invasion</em>. It is
necessary to draw clearly the line between complete and partial invasion in
this connection. The former is temporary in the initial or intermediate
stages of nearly all successions, as compared with the ultimate stages,
though it is in a large degree permanent in comparison with the partial
invasion of species which are able to maintain themselves for a few years.
In a sense, there is a real distinction between the two, inasmuch as a particular
stage of succession is permanent as long as the habitat remains
essentially the same. A critical study of the species of such stages shows,
however, that they manifest very different degrees of permanence. Species
which invade stable vegetation temporarily have been termed <em>adventive</em> by
A. DeCandolle. <em>Permanent invasion</em> occurs when a species becomes permanently
established in a more or less stable formation. It is characteristic
of the great majority of invaders found in the grassland and forest stages
of successions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plants which have arisen within a formation or have been a constituent
part of it since its origin are <em>indigenous</em>. Contrasted with these are the
species which have invaded the formation since it received its distinctive
impress: these are <em>derived</em>. The determination of the indigenous and
derived species of a formation or larger division is of the utmost importance,
as it enables us to retrace the steps by which the formation has reached its
present structure, and to reconstruct formations long since disappeared. To
render it less difficult, it is necessary to scrutinize the derived elements
closely, first, because it is easiest to recognize the indigenous species by
eliminating the derived, and second, because this analysis will show that
not all derived species have entered the formation at the same time and
from the same sources. Derived species may be termed <em>vicine</em>, when they
are fully established invaders from adjacent formations or regions, and
<em>adventitious</em>, when they have come from distant formations and have succeeded
in establishing themselves. Finally, those derived species which are
unable to establish themselves permanently are <em>adventive</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>MANNER OF INVASION</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>285. Entrance into the habitat.</b> Since the ecesis of invaders depends in
large measure upon the occupation of the plants in possession, the method
and degree of invasion will be determined by the presence or absence of
vegetation. Areas without vegetation are either originally <em>naked or denuded</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>while vegetation with respect to the degree of occupation is open
(<em>sporadophytia</em>), or closed (<em>pycnophytia</em>). Each type of area presents different
conditions to invaders, largely with respect to the factors determining
ecesis. Naked habitats, rocks, talus, gravel slides, and dunes, while they
offer ample opportunity for invasion on account of the lack of occupation,
are really invaded with the greatest difficulty, not only because they contain
originally few or no disseminules, but also because of their xerophytic
character and the difficulty of obtaining a foothold, on account of the extreme
density or instability of the soil. Denuded habitats, blowouts, sand
draws, ponds, flood plains, wastes, fields, and burns, usually afford maximum
opportunity for invasion. They invariably contain a large number of disseminules
ready to spring up as soon as the original vegetation is destroyed.
The surface, moreover, is usually such as to catch disseminules and to offer
them optimum conditions of moisture and nutrition. Open formations are
readily invaded, though the increased occupation renders entrance more
difficult than it is in denuded areas. Closed formations, on the other hand,
are characterized by a minimum of invasion, partly because invaders from
different formations find unfavorable conditions in them, but chiefly because
the occupation of the inhabitants is so complete that invaders are
unable to establish themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Invasion takes place by the penetration of single individuals or groups
of individuals. This will depend in the first place upon the character of
the disseminule. It is evident that, no matter how numerous the achenes may
be, the invasion of those anemochorous species with comate or winged seeds
or one-seeded fruits will be of the first type, while all species in which the
disseminule is a several or many-seeded fruit or plant, as in hooked fruits,
tumbleweeds, etc., will tend to produce a group of invaders. Occasionally
of course, the accidents of migration will bring together a few one-seeded
disseminules into a group, or will scatter the seeds of a many-seeded fruit,
but these constitute relatively rare exceptions. This distinction in the matter
of invasion is of value in studying the relative rapidity of the latter, and the
establishment of new centers, but it is of greatest importance in explaining
the historical arrangement of species in a formation, and hence has a direct
bearing upon alternation. It is entirely independent of the number of
invaders, which, as we have seen, depends upon seed-production, mobility,
distance, occupation, etc., but is based solely upon mode of arrangement,
and will be found to underlie the primary types of abundance, copious, and
gregarious. In this connection, it should also be noted that the contingencies
of migration, especially the concomitant action in the same direction of
two or more distributive agencies, often results in the penetration of a
group of individuals belonging to two or more species. This may well be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>termed <em>mass invasion</em>; it is characteristic of transition areas or regions, and
along valleys or other natural routes for migration it gives rise to species
guilds. The movement of species guilds constitutes one of the most complex
and interesting problems in the whole field of invasion, the solution
of which can be attempted only after the thorough analysis of the simpler
invasions between formations. A better understanding of the meaning of
invasion by species guilds is imperative for the natural limitation of regions,
as at present such groups constitute alien associations in many regions otherwise
homogeneous.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>286. Influence of levels.</b> The invasion of a formation may occur at three
different levels: (1) at the level of the facies, (2) below the facies, (3)
above the facies, depending directly upon the relative height of invaders
and occupants. The invasion level is an extremely simple matter to determine,
except in the case of woody plants, such as shrubs and trees, which
attain their average height only after many years. Its importance is fundamental.
The level at which invasion occurs not only determines the
immediate constitution of the formation, whether its impress shall still be
given by the occupants or by the invaders or by both together, but it also
decides the whole future of the formation, i. e., whether the invaders or
occupants shall persist unmodified or modified. The problem is an extremely
complex one, but the careful analysis of invasion at each level throws a
flood of light upon it. The entrance of invaders of the same general height
as the facies of a formation results regularly in mixed formations. This is
well illustrated by the structure of the transition areas between two formations
of the same category, i. e., forests, meadows, etc. It is seldom,
however, that the facies and invaders are so equally matched in height and
other qualities that they remain in equilibrium for a long period. One or
the other has a slight advantage in height, or the one suffers shading or
crowding better than the other, is longer-lived or faster-growing, with the
result that invader yields to occupant, or occupant to invader. It is a well-known
fact that many mixed formations represent intermediate stages of
development.</p>

<p class='c007'>Invasion at a level different from that of the facies is inevitably followed
by modification. If the invasion takes place below the facies, the invaders
will be exterminated gradually, or slowly assimilated. In either case, there
is little structural change in the formation, and its stability is affected
slightly or not at all. If the invaders overtop the facies in any considerable
number, the entire formation undergoes partial or complete modification,
or in extreme cases it disappears, as is typically the case in succession. A
peculiar variation of invasion at a level above the facies is seen where woody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>plants invade grassland, when the trees or shrubs become more or less uniformly
scattered in an open woodland or open thicket. Here the grassland
takes on an altogether different appearance superficially, though it is usually
unchanged, except beneath and about the invaders, where either adaptation
or extermination results. Finally, it should be borne in mind that the invasion
of a particular formation, especially in the case of layered thickets and
forests, often takes place at two levels, at the height of the facies and below
the facies.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>INVESTIGATION OF INVASION</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>287.</b> The methods to be used in the study of invasion are those already
described elsewhere. The migration circle is of the first importance because
it makes it possible to secure an accurate record of actual movement. Quadrat
and transect are valuable, but from their nature they are more serviceable
for ecesis than for migration. All of these should be of the permanent
type, in order that the fate of invaders may be followed for several years at
least. Permanent areas furnish evidence of the changes wrought in the
actual vegetation, while denuded ones can serve only to show the potential
migration and ecesis of the constituent species. Transition zones and areas
are special seats of invasion; they are best studied by means of the belt transect
and the ecotone chart. The movement of a line of invaders or of scattered
outposts is traced by the use of labeled stakes at the points concerned.
It is clear that this method will yield conclusive data in regard to the great
invasions between regions, such as the movement of species guilds, the advance
of the forest frontier, etc. When invasion is scattered, factor instruments
can not be used to advantage, but where the invading line is well
marked, or where extra-formational areas occur, a knowledge of the physical
factors is a great aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>An invasion that has been completed can not be studied in the manner indicated.
A method of comparison must be used, in order to determine the
original home of the invaders. For this an exact knowledge of the contiguous
formations and of the abundance of the species common to all is a prerequisite.
With this as a basis, it is usually a simple task to refer all the
species of the formation concerned to their proper place in the groups, indigenous,
derived, and adventitious.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>SUCCESSION</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>288. Concept.</b> Succession is the phenomenon in which a series of invasions
occurs in the same spot. It is important, however, to distinguish clearly
between succession and invasion, for, while the one is the direct result of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>other, not all invasion produces succession. The number of invaders must be
large enough, or their effect must be sufficiently modifying or controlling to
bring about the gradual decrease or disappearance of the original occupants,
or a succession will not be established. Partial or temporary invasion can
never initiate a succession unless the reaction of the invaders upon the habitat
is very great. Complete and permanent invasion, on the other hand, regularly
produces successions, except in the rare cases where a stable formation entirely
replaces a less stable one without the intervention of other stages.
Succession depends in the first degree upon invasion in such quantity and of
such character that the reaction of the invaders upon the habitat will prepare
the way for further invasion. The characteristic presence of stages in a
succession, which normally correspond to formations, is due to the peculiar
operation of invasion with reaction. In the case of a denuded habitat, for
example, migration from adjacent formations is constantly taking place, but
only a small number of migrants, especially adapted to somewhat extreme
conditions, are able to become established in it. These reach a maximum
development in size or number, and in so doing react upon the habitat in
such a way that more and more of the dormant disseminules present, as well
as those constantly coming into it, find the conditions favorable for germination
and growth. The latter, as they in turn attain their maximum, cause
the gradual disappearance of the species of the first stage, and at the same
time prepare the way for the individuals of the succeeding formation. It is
at present impossible to determine to what degree this substitution is due to
the struggle for existence between the individuals of each species and between
the somewhat similar species of each stage, and to what degree it
arises out of the physical reaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that geological succession is but a larger expression of the
same phenomenon, dealing with infinitely greater periods of time, and produced
by physical changes of such intensity as to give each geological stage
its peculiar stamp. If, however, the geological record were sufficiently complete,
we should find unquestionably that these great successions merely represent
the stable termini of many series of smaller changes, such as are
found everywhere in recent or existing vegetation.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>289. Kinds of succession.</b> The fundamental causes of succession are invasion
and reaction, but the initial causes of a particular succession are to
be sought in the physical or biological disturbances of a habitat or formation.
With reference to the initial cause, we may distinguish <em>normal succession</em>,
which begins with nudation, and ends in stabilization, and <em>anomalous
succession</em>, in which the facies of an ultimate stage of a normal succession are
replaced by other species, or in which the direction of movement is radically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>changed. The former is of universal occurrence and recurrence; the latter
operates upon relatively few ultimate formations. In the origin of normal
successions, nudation may be brought about by the production of new soils
or habitats, or by the destruction of the formation which already occupies a
habitat. In a few cases, the way in which the habitat arises or becomes denuded
is not decisive as to the vegetation that is developed upon it, but as a
rule the cause of nudation plays as important a part in the development of
a succession as does the reaction exerted by the invaders. The importance
of this fact has been insisted upon under invasion. New soils present extreme
conditions for ecesis, possess few or no dormant disseminules, and in
consequence their successions take place slowly and exhibit many stages.
Denuded soils as a rule offer optimum conditions for ecesis as a result of
the action of the previous succession, dormant seeds and propagules are
abundant, and the revegetation of such habitats takes place rapidly and
shows few stages. The former may be termed <em>primary succession</em>, the latter
<em>secondary succession</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>PRIMARY SUCCESSIONS</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>290.</b> These arise on newly formed soils, or upon surfaces exposed for the
first time, which have in consequence never borne vegetation before. In
general they are characteristic of mountain regions, where weathering is the
rule, and of lowlands and shores, where sedimentation or elevation constantly
occur. The principal physical phenomena which bring about the
formation of new soils are: (1) elevation, (2) volcanic action, (3) weathering,
with or without transport.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>291. Succession through elevation.</b> Elevation was of very frequent occurrence
during the earlier, more plastic conditions of the earth, and the successions
arising as a result of it must have been important features of the
vegetation of geological periods. To-day, elevation is of much less importance
in changing physiography, and its operation is confined to volcanic
islands, coral reefs, and islets, and to rare movements or displacements in
seacoasts, lake beds, shore lines, etc. There has been no investigation of the
development of vegetation on islands that are rising, or have recently been
elevated, probably because of the slow growth of coral reefs and the rare
appearance of volcanic islands. On coral reefs, the first vegetation is invariably
marine, but as the reef rises higher above the surf line and the tide,
the vegetation passes into a xerophytic terrestrial type adapted to an impervious
rock soil, and ultimately becomes mesophytic. In volcanic islands,
unless they are mere rocks over which the waves rush, the succession must
always begin with a xerophytic rock formation. The best known example
of a rising coast line is found in Norway and Sweden, where the southeastern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>coast is rising at the rate of five or six feet a century. There can be little
question that such changes of level will produce marked changes in vegetation,
but the modification will be so gradual as to be scarcely perceptible in a
single generation. It is probable that the forests of the Atlantic coastal
plains are the ultimate stages of successions initiated at the time of the final
elevation of the sea bottom along the coast line.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>292. Succession through volcanic action.</b> The deposition of volcanic
ashes and flows of lava are relatively infrequent at present, occurring only
in the immediate vicinity of active volcanoes, chiefly in or near the tropics.
Successions of this sort are in consequence not only rare, but they are also
relatively inaccessible to investigators. They have been studied in a few
cases, for example, those of Krakatoa by Treub, but this study has been confined
to the general features of revegetation. Ash fields and lava beds are
widely different in compactness, but they agree in having a low water- and
nutrition-content. The pioneer plants in both will be intense xerophytes, but
the soil differences will determine that these shall be sand-binders in the former,
and rock-weathering plants in the latter.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span><b>293. Weathering.</b> Practically all primary successions start on soils produced
by weathering. This is also true of coral or volcanic islets and of lava
beds, for no terrestrial vegetation can secure a foothold upon them until the
surface of the rock has been to some extent decomposed or disintegrated.
Weathering, as is well known, consists of two processes, disintegration and
decomposition, which usually operate successively, though they are sometimes
concomitant. Disintegration usually precedes, especially in rock
masses, and unless it is soon followed by decomposition, results in dysgeogenous
soils. Decomposition often goes hand in hand with disintegration,
or it takes place so rapidly and perfectly that it alone seems to be present.
In either case, the resulting soil is eugeogenous. The relation of decomposition
to disintegration determines the size and compactness of the soil particles,
and upon the latter depend the porosity, capillarity, and hygroscopicity
of the soil. These control in large degree the character of the first
vegetation to appear on the soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another point of fundamental value in determining revegetation is the
disposition of the weathered rock. If it remains <em>in situ</em>, it will evidently
differ in respect to compactness, homogeneity, nutrition-content, water-content,
disseminules, etc., from weathered material which has been transported.
An essential difference also arises from the fact that a rock may be weathered
a long distance from the place where the decomposed particles are finally
deposited, and in the midst of a vegetation very different from that found
in the region of deposit. The disposition of the weathered material affords
in consequence a satisfactory basis for the arrangement of primary successions.
The following classification is proposed, based upon the soil groups
established by Merrill.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c017'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><b>294. Succession in residuary soils.</b> Residuary soils are always sedentary,
i. e., they are formed <em>in situ</em>. They show certain differences dependent upon
the rock from which they originate, which may be mixed crystalline shale,
sandstone, or limestone, but the thoroughness of decomposition causes these
differences to be comparatively small. Residuary soils are typically eugeogenous;
their successions in consequence usually begin with mesophytes, and
consist of a few stages. The soluble salt-content is comparatively low, since
all soluble matters are readily leached out. Successions in these soils are
especially characteristic of shale, sandstone, and limestone ledges or banks.
Cumulose deposits, like residuary ones, are sedentary in character, but as
they are produced by the accumulation of organic matter, they will be considered
under reactions of vegetation upon habitat.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>295. Succession in colluvial soils.</b> Colluvial deposits owe their aggregation
solely or chiefly to the action of gravity. They are the immediate result
of the disintegration of cliffs, ledges, and mountain sides, decomposition appearing
later as a secondary factor. The masses and particles arising from
disintegration are extremely variable in size, but they agree as a rule in their
angular shape. The typical example of the colluvial deposit is the talus,
which may originate from any kind of rock, and contains pieces of all sizes.
Gravel slides differ from ordinary talus in being composed of more uniform
particles, which are worn round by slipping down the slope in response to
gravity and surface wash. Boulder fields are to be regarded as talus produced
by weathering under the influence of joints, resulting in huge boulders
which become more and more rounded under the action of water and
gravity. This statement applies to those fields which are in connection with
some cliff that is weathering in this fashion; otherwise, boulder fields are of
aqueous or glacial origin. The character of the successions in talus will
depend upon the kind of rock in the latter. If the rock is igneous or metamorphic,
decomposition will be slow, and the soil will be dysgeogenous.
Successions on such talus consist of many stages, and the formations are for
a long time open and xerophytic. In talus formed from sedimentary rocks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>especially shales, limestones, and calcareous sandstones, decomposition is
much more rapid, and the successions are simpler and more mesophytic.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>296. Succession in alluvial soils.</b> Alluvial soils are fluvial when laid down
by streams and rivers, and litoral when washed up by the waves or tides.
They are formed when any obstacle retards the movement of the water, decreasing
its carrying power, and causing the deposit of part or all of its load.
They consist of more or less rounded, finely comminuted particles, mingled
with organic matter and detritus. Alluvial deposits are especially frequent
at the mouth of streams and rivers, on their terraces and flood plains, and
along silting banks as compared with the erosion banks of meanders. The
filling of ponds by the erosion due to surface drainage, and of lakes by the
deposition of the loads of streams that enter them, results in the formation
of new alluvium. A similar phenomenon occurs along coasts, where bays
and inlets are slowly converted into marshes in consequence of being shallowed
by the material washed in by the waves and tides. Such paludal deposits
are invariably salt water or brackish. Contrasted with these, which
are uniformly black in consequence of the large amount of organic matter
present, are the sandbars and beaches, which, though due to the same agents,
are light grey or white in color, because of the constant leaching by the
waves. Two kinds of alluvial deposits may accordingly be distinguished:
(1) those black with organic matter, and little disturbed by water, and (2)
those of a light color, which are constantly swept by the waves. The successions
corresponding to these are radically different. In the first, the pioneer
vegetation is hydrophytic, consisting largely of amphibious plants.
The pioneer stages retard the movement of the water more and more, and
correspondingly hasten the deposition of its load. The marsh bed slowly
rises in consequence, and finally the marsh begins to dry out, passing first
into a wet meadow, and then into a meadow of the normal type. A notable
exception to this sequence occurs when the swamp contains organic matter
or salts in excess, in which case the vegetation consists indefinitely of swamp
xerophytes, or halophytes. The first vegetation on fresh water sandbars is
xerophytic, or, properly, dissophytic, unless they remain water-swept, and
the ultimate stages of their successions are mesophytic woodlands composed
of water-loving genera, <em>Populus</em>, <em>Salix</em>, etc. It seems certain, however, that
these will finally give way to longer-lived hardwoods. Maritime sandbars
and beaches are always saline, and their successions run their short course
of development entirely within the group of halophytes, unless the retreat
of the sea or freshwater floods change the character of the soil. The chemical
action of underground waters also produces new soils, which might be
classed as alluvial. These soils are essentially rock deposits, travertine, silicious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>sinter, etc., made by iron and lime springs and by geysers, and they
must be changed by decomposition into soils proper to be comparable with
alluvial soils.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>297. Succession in aeolian soils.</b> The only wind-borne soils of geological
importance at the present time are those which form dunes, both inland and
coastal. Aeolian deposits consist largely of rounded sand particles, which
are of almost uniform size in any particular dune, but vary greatly in dunes
of different ages. The reaction of the pioneers on dunes plays an important
part in building the latter, but the immense dunes of inland deserts, which
are entirely destitute of vegetation, seem to indicate that its value has been
overestimated. The first stages in dune successions are dissophytic, i. e., the
plants grow in a soil of medium or high water-content, but in an atmosphere
that is extremely xerophytic. The ultimate stages vary widely in accordance
with the region in which they occur; they may be xerophytic heaths or
mesophytic meadows and forests. Because of their striking character and
economic significance, dunes have received much attention, with the result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>that their successions are the most thoroughly known of all. Prairie and
steppe formations are probably to be regarded as the ultimate stages of successions
established on wind-borne loess, and it is possible that the same is
true of sand-hill vegetation in the prairie province.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>298. Succession in glacial soils.</b> The formation of glacial deposits is at
present confined to alpine and arctic regions. Recent successions in such
soils are localized in these regions, and are in consequence relatively unimportant.
There can be little question, however, that the thorough investigation
of succession in and near the moraines of existing glaciers will throw
much light upon the successions of the glacial period. Moraines, drumlins,
eskars, and alluvial cones represent the various kinds of glacial deposits.
They agree in being heterogeneous in composition, and are covered to-day
with ultimate stages of vegetation, except in the immediate vicinity of
glaciers.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>SECONDARY SUCCESSIONS</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>299.</b> Generally speaking, all successions on denuded soils are secondary.
When vegetation is completely removed by excessive erosion, it is an open
question whether the resulting habitat is to be regarded as new or denuded.
Erosion is rarely so extreme and so rapid, however, as to produce such a
condition, even when it results from cultivation or deforestation. It is, moreover,
especially characteristic of newly formed soils, and in studying succession
in eroded habitats, it is fundamentally important to determine whether
erosion has produced denudation, or has operated upon a new soil. The
great majority of secondary successions owe their origin to floods, animals,
or the activities of man, and they agree in occurring upon decomposed soils
of medium water-content, which contain considerable organic matter, and a
large number of dormant migrants. These successions consist of relatively
few stages, and are rarely of extreme character.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>300. Succession in eroded soils.</b> Eroded soils show considerable differences,
as they arise in consequence of erosion by water or by wind, though
the initial stages of revegetation derive their character more from the aggregation
of the soil than from the nature of the erosive agent. Eroded soils
are as a rule xerophytic. In the case of erosion by water, dysgeogenous soils
are readily worn away in consequence of their lack of cohesion, as in sand draws,
etc., while eugeogenous soils are easily eroded only on slopes, as in
the case of ravines, hillsides, etc. In the former, the extreme porosity and
slight capillarity of the sand and gravel result in a low water-content. In
the finer soils, the water-content is also low, on account of the excessive run-off,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>due to compactness of the particles and to the slope. The erosive action
of winds upon soils bearing vegetation is not very general; it is found to
some extent in more or less established dunes, and exists in a marked degree
in buttes, mushroom rocks, and blowouts. The first two are regularly xerophytic,
the last as a rule, dissophytic. The early stages of successions in
eroded soils are composed of xerophytes. In loose soils, these are forms
capable of binding the soil particles together, thus preventing wash, and increasing
the accumulation of fine particles, especially of organic matter. In
compact soils, the effect is much the same; the pioneers not only decrease
erosion, but at the same time also increase the water-content by retarding the
movement of the run-off.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>301. Succession in flooded soils.</b> The universal response of vegetation to
floods is found in the amphibious plant, which is a plastic form capable of
adjustment to very different water-contents. Floods are confined largely to
river basins and coasts. In hilly and mountainous regions, where the slope
is great, any considerable accumulation of flood waters is now impossible,
although of frequent occurrence when land forms were more plastic.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all streams that have become graded, the fall is insufficient to carry off
the surplus water in the spring when snows are melting rapidly, or at times
of unusual precipitation. These waters accumulate, and, overflowing the
banks, spread out over the lowlands, resulting in the formation of a well-defined
flood plain. This is a periodical occurrence with mature streams,
and it occurs more or less regularly with all that are not torrent-like in character.
The effect of the overflow is to destroy or to place at a disadvantage
those plants of the flood plain that are not hydrophytes. At the same time,
a thin layer of fresh silt is deposited upon the valley floor of sand or alluvium.
Flooding is most frequent and of longest duration near the banks of
the stream. It extends more or less uniformly over the flood plain, and disappears
gradually or abruptly as the latter rises into the bench above. Floods
destroy vegetation and make a place for secondary successions by drowning
out mesophytic species, by washing away the aquatic forms of ponds and
pools, and by the erosion of banks and sandbars. They affect the amphibious
vegetation of swamp and shore to a certain extent, but, unless the period
of flooding is long, they tend to emphasize such formations rather than to
destroy them. The still-water formations of many cutoff and oxbow lakes
owe their origin to a river which cuts across a meander in time of flood.
This result is more often attained by the alternate silting and erosion of a
meandering river by which it cuts across a bend in its channel. The usual
successions in flooded lands are short as a rule; amphibious algae, liverworts,
and mosses soon give way to ruderal plants, and these in turn to the original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>mesophytes of meadows, or dissophytes of sandbars. In the case of ponds
and pools, the process of washing-out or silting up merely removes or destroys
the vegetation, without effectively modifying the habitat, and the secondary
successions that follow are extremely short.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>302. Succession by subsidence.</b> Subsidence is a factor of the most profound
importance in changing vegetation. It operates over vast areas
through immense periods of time. For these reasons, the changes are so
slow as to be almost imperceptible, and the resulting successions can be
studied only in the geological record. Extensive subsidence is confined to-day
to coastal plains, as in Greenland, the south Atlantic coast, and the region
of the Mississippi delta, where its effects are merged with the paludation of
tidal rivers, and the wave and tide erosion of the sea shore. Such successions
are unique, inasmuch as the denuding force operates very slowly instead
of quickly, and the first pioneers of the new vegetation appear before
the original formation has been destroyed. In all cases, the succession is
from mesophytic or halophytic formations to paludose, and, finally, marine
vegetation. In small areas of subsidence, such as shore slips along lakes
and streams, sink holes, and sunken bogs, the succession is usually both short
and simple, mesophytes giving place to amphibious and ultimately to aquatic
forms.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>303. Successions in landslips.</b> Landslips occur only in montane and hilly
regions, and here they are merely of local importance. In many respects,
they are not unlike talus; they show essential differences, however, in that
they are not sorted by gravity, and in that they destroy vegetation almost
instantly. The succession arises as a rule, not upon the original soil, but
upon that of the landslip, and, as pointed out elsewhere, might well be regarded
as primary.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>304. Succession in drained, or dried soils.</b> In geological times, the subsidence
of barriers must often have produced drainage and drying-out, just as
elevation frequently resulted in flooding and lake formation. At the present
time, the drying-out of lakes and ponds is the result of artificial drainage, or
of climatic changes. The former will be considered under successions
brought about by the agency of man. Climatic changes when general operate
so slowly that the stages of such successions are perceptible only when
recorded in strata. More locally, climate swings back and forth through a
period of years, with the result that in dry years the swamps and ponds of
wetter seasons are dried out, and the vegetation destroyed or changed. If
the process be gradual, the succession passes from hydrophytic through amphibious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>to mesophytic, and, in dry regions, xerophytic conditions. When
the process of drying-out occurs rapidly, as in a single summer, the original
formation is destroyed, and the new vegetation consists largely of ruderal
plants. A peculiar effect of climate occurs in regions with poor drainage,
where the result of intense evaporation is to produce alkaline basins and salt
lakes, in which the succession becomes more and more open, and is finally
represented by a few stabilized halophytes, or disappears completely.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>305. Succession by animal agency.</b> Successions of this class are altogether
of secondary importance, the instances in which animals produce denudation
being relatively few. Such are the heaps of dirt thrown up by
prairie dogs and other burrowing animals, upon which ruderal plants are
first established, to be finally crowded out by the species of the original formation.
Buffalo wallows furnish examples of similar successions in which
the initial stages are subruderal, while overstocking and overgrazing frequently
produce the same result with ruderal plants.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>306. Succession by human agency.</b> The activities of man in changing
the surface of the earth are so diverse that it is impossible to fit the resulting
successions in a natural system. While man does not exactly make new
soils, he exposes soils in various operations: mining, irrigation, railroad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>building, etc. He destroys vegetation by fires, lumbering, cultivation, and
drainage, and if he can not control climate, he at least modifies its natural
effects by irrigation and the conservation of moisture. The operations of
man extend from seacoasts and swampy lowlands through mesophytic
forests and prairies to the driest uplands and inlands. Since the adjacent
formations determine in large degree the course and constitution of a succession,
it will be seen that the effects of any particular activity upon vegetation
will differ greatly in different regions. For convenience, all classes of
successions arising from the presence and activity of man will be considered
in this place, though, as indicated above, some might well be regarded as
producing primary successions, while others produce anomalous ones.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>307. Succession in burned areas.</b> It will suffice merely to point out that
“burns” may arise naturally through lightning, volcanic cinders, lava flows,
etc., but the chances are so slight that these causes may be ignored. The
causes of fires are legion, and as they have little or no effect upon results,
they need not be considered. From their nature, fires are of little significance
in open vegetation, deserts, polar barrens, alpine fields, etc., since the
area of the burn can never be large. In closed formations, the extent of
fires is limited only by the area of the vegetation, and the effect of wind,
rain, and other forces. Forest fires usually occur during the resting period,
except in the case of coniferous forests. In grassland, the living parts are
underground during autumn and winter, when prairie fires commonly occur.
As a consequence, the repeated annual burning of meadow or prairie does
not result in denudation and subsequent succession. On the contrary, it
acts in part as a stabilizing agent, inasmuch as it injures the typical vegetation
forms of grassland much less than it does the woody invaders. All formations
with perennial parts above ground, viz., thicket, open woodland,
and forest, are seriously injured by fire. A severe general fire destroys the
vegetation completely; a local fire destroys the formation in restricted areas;
while a slight or superficial burn removes the undergrowth and hastens the
disappearance of the weaker trees. In the latter case, while the primary
layer of the forest remains the same, succession takes place in the herbaceous
and shrubby layers. These successions are peculiar in that they are composed
almost wholly of the proper species of the forest, and that they are
very short, showing only a few poorly defined stages. A local fire initiates
a succession in which the pioneers are derived largely from the original formation,
particularly when the latter encloses the burned area more or less
completely. The constitution of the intermediate and ultimate stages will
depend in a larger degree still upon the size and position of the burn. When
a particular formation is destroyed wholly or in large part, the first stages
of the new vegetation are made up by invaders from the adjacent formations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>In the most perfect types of succession, this dissimilarity between the new
and the old vegetation continues to the last stage, in which the reappearance
of the facies precedes that of the subordinate layers. In many forest successions,
however, the general physical similarity of the ultimate stages permits
the early reappearance of the herbaceous and shrubby species, and the
final stages affect the facies alone. Successions in burned areas operate usually
within the water-content groups. The reconstruction of a mesophytic
forest takes place by means of mesophytes; of the rarer xerophytic and hydrophytic
forests, through xerophytes and hydrophytes respectively. This
is due to the fact that the alteration of the soil is slight, except where the
burning of the vegetation permits the entrance of erosion, as on mountain
slopes.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>308. Succession in lumbered areas.</b> Commercial lumbering, especially
where practiced for wood-pulp as well as for timber, results in complete or
nearly complete destruction of the vegetation by removal and the change
from diffuse light to sunlight, or by the action of erosion upon the exposed
surface. In the first place, short mesophytic successions will result; in the
second, the successions will be long and complex, passing through decreasingly
xerophytic conditions to a stable mesophytic forest. Where a forest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>is cut over for certain species alone, the undisturbed trees soon take full possession,
though the causes effective in the beginning will ultimately restore
the original facies in many instances. Such successions are anomalous, and
will be treated under that head.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>309. Succession by cultivation.</b> The clearing of forests and the “breaking”
of grassland for cultivation destroy the original vegetation; the temporary
or permanent abandonment of cultivated fields then permits the entrance
of ruderal species, which are the pioneers of new successions. This phenomenon
takes place annually in fields after harvest, resulting in the secondary
formations of Warming, in which practically the same species reappear
year after year. In fields that lie fallow for several years, or are permanently
abandoned, the first ruderal plants are displaced by newcomers, or
certain of them become dominant at the expense of others. In a few years,
these are crowded out by invaders from the adjacent formations, and the
field is ultimately reclaimed by the original vegetation, unless this has entirely
disappeared from the region. The number of stages depends chiefly
upon whether the final formation is to be grassland or woodland. Other
activities of man, such as the construction of buildings, roads, railways,
canals, etc., remove the native vegetation, and make room for the rapid development
of ruderal formations. In and about cities, where the original
formations have entirely disappeared, the chance for succession is remote,
and the initial ruderal stages become more or less stabilized. Elsewhere
the usual successions are established, and the ruderal formation finally gives
way to the dominant type. In mountain and desert regions, where ruderal
plants are rare or lacking, their place is taken by subruderal forms, species
of the native vegetation capable of rapid movement in them. These, like
ruderal plants, are gradually replaced by other native species of less mobility,
but of greater persistence, resulting in a short succession operating often
within a single formation. From the nature of cultivated plants, succession
after cultivation generally operates within the mesophytic series.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>310. Succession by drainage.</b> Successions of this kind show much the
same stages as are found in those due to flooding. They proceed from
aquatic or swamp formations to mesophytic termini, either grassland or
woodland. When drainage takes place rapidly and completely, the pioneer
stages are usually xerophytic; cases of this sort, however, are infrequent.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>311. Succession by irrigation.</b> Irrigation produces short successions of
peculiar stamp along the courses of irrigating canals and ditches, and in the
vicinity of reservoirs. These are recent, as a rule, and are usually found in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the midst of cultivated lands, so that their complete history is still a matter
of conjecture. The original xerophytes are forced out not only by the disturbance
of the soil, but also by its increased water-content. A few of them
often thrive under the new conditions, and, together with the usual ruderal
plants and a large number of lowland mesophytes and amphibious forms
derived from the banks of the parent stream, constitute a heterogeneous association.
This is doubtless to be regarded as an initial stage of a succession,
but it is an open question whether the succession will early be stabilized
as a new formation, or whether the original vegetation will sooner or later
be reestablished under somewhat mesophytic conditions. From the number
of mesophytes and from the behavior of valleys, it seems certain that the
banks of such canals will ultimately be occupied by a formation more mesophytic
than hydrophytic, into which some of the surrounding xerophytes of
plastic nature have been adopted.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>312. Anomalous successions</b> are those in which the physical change in the
habitat is relatively slight, resulting in a displacement of the ultimate stage,
or the disturbance of the usual sequence, merely, instead of the destruction
and reconstruction of a formation, or the gradual development of a new
series of stages on new soil. In nature, the ultimate grass or forest stage
of a normal succession is often replaced by a similar formation, especially
if the facies be few or single. It is evident that certain trees naturally replace
others in the last stages of a forest succession, without making the latter
anomalous. The last occurs only when a normal stage is replaced by
one belonging properly to an entirely different succession, as when a coniferous
forest replaces a deciduous one in a hardwood region. The presence
and development of such successions can be determined only after the normal
types are known. The interpolation of a foreign stage in a natural succession,
or a change of direction, by which a succession that is mesotropic
again becomes hydrophytic, is easily explained when it is the result of artificial
agents, as is often the case. In nature, anomalous successions are
commonly the result of a slow backward and forward swing of climatic
conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>313. Perfect and imperfect successions.</b> A normal succession will regularly
be perfect; it passes in the usual sequence from initial to ultimate conditions
without interruption or omission. Imperfect succession results when
one or more of the ordinary stages is omitted anywhere in the course, and a
later stage appears before its turn. It will occur at any time when a new or
denuded habitat becomes so surrounded by other vegetation that the formations
which usually furnish the next invaders are unable to do so, or when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>the abundance and mobility of certain species enable them to take possession
before their proper turn, and to the exclusion of the regular stage. Incomplete
successions are of great significance, inasmuch as they indicate that the
stages of a succession are often due more to biological than to physical causes,
the proximity and mobility of the adjacent species being more determinative
than the physical factors. Subalpine gravel slides regularly pass through
the rosette, mat, turf, thicket, woodland, and forest stages; occasionally,
however, they pass immediately from the rosette, or mat condition, to an
aspen thicket which represents the next to the last stage. Such successions
are by no means infrequent in hilly and montane regions; in regions physiographically
more mature or stable, perfect successions are almost invariably
the rule.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>314. Stabilization.</b> It may be stated as a general principle that vegetation
moves constantly and gradually toward stabilization. Each successive stage
modifies the physical factors, and dominates the habitat more and more, in
such a way that the latter seems to respond to the formation rather than this
to the habitat. The more advanced the succession, i. e., the degree of stabilization,
the greater the climatic or physiographic change necessary to
disturb it, with the result that such disturbances are much more frequent in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the earlier stages than in the later development. Constant, gradual movement
toward a stable formation is characteristic of continuous succession.
Contrasted with this is intermittent succession, in which the succession
swings for a time in one direction, from xerophytic to mesophytic for example,
and then moves in the opposite direction, often passing through the
same stages. This phenomenon usually is characteristic only of the less
stable stages, and is generally produced by a climatic swing, in which a series
of hot or dry years is followed by one of cold or wet years, or the reverse.
The same effect upon a vast scale is produced by alternate elevation and
subsidence, but these operate through such great periods of time that one
can not trace, but can only conjecture their effects. A normal continuous
succession frequently changes its direction of movement, or its type, in transition
regions or in areas where the outposts of a new flora are rapidly advancing,
as in wide mesophytic valleys that run down into or traverse plains.
Here the change is often sudden, and grass and desert formations are
replaced by thickets and forests, resulting in abrupt succession. Species
guilds are typical examples of this. More rarely, a stage foreign to the
succession will be interpolated, replacing a normal stage, or slipping in between
two such, though finally disappearing before the next regular formation.
This may be distinguished as interpolated succession.</p>

<p class='c007'>The apparent terminus of all stabilization is the forest, on account of the
thoroughness with which it controls the habitat. A close examination of
vegetation, however, will show that its stable terms are dependent in the first
degree upon the character of the region in which the formation is indigenous.
It is obviously impossible that successions in desert lands, in polar barrens,
or upon alpine stretches should terminate in forest stages. In these, grassland
must be the ultimate condition, except in those extreme habitats, alpine
and polar, where mosses and lichens represent the highest type of existing
vegetation. Forests are ultimate for all successions in habitats belonging to
a region generally wooded, while grassland represents the terminus of prairie
and plains successions as well as of many arctic-alpine ones.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>CAUSES AND REACTIONS</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>315.</b> The initial cause of a succession must be sought in a physical change
in the habitat; its continuance depends upon the reaction which each stage
of vegetation exerts upon the physical factors which constitute the habitat.
A single exception to this is found in anomalous successions, where the
change of formation often hinges upon the appearance of remote or foreign
disseminules. The causes which initiate successions have already been considered;
they may be summarized as follows: (1) weathering, (2) erosion,
(3) elevation, (4) subsidence, (5) climatic changes, (6) artificial changes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>The effect of succeeding stages of vegetation upon a new or denuded habitat
usually finds expression in a change of the habitat with respect to a particular
factor, and in a definite direction. Often, there is a primary reaction,
and one or more secondary ones, which are corollaries of it. Rarely, there
are two or more coordinate reactions. The general ways in which vegetation
reacts upon the habitat are the following: (1) by preventing weathering,
(2) by binding aeolian soils, (3) by reducing run-off and preventing
erosion, (4) by filling with silt and plant remains, (5) by enriching the
soil, (6) by exhausting the soil, (7) by accumulating humus, (8) by modifying
atmospheric factors. The direction of the movement of a succession
is the immediate result of its reaction. From the fundamental nature of
vegetation, it must be expressed in terms of water-content. The reaction is
often so great that the habitat undergoes a profound change in the course
of the succession, changing from hydrophytic to mesophytic or xerophytic,
or the reverse. This is characteristic of newly formed or exposed soils.
Such successions are <em>xerotropic</em>, <em>mesotropic</em>, or <em>hydrotropic</em>, according to
the ultimate condition of the habitat. When the reaction is less marked,
the type of habitat does not change materially, and the successions are <em>xerostatic</em>,
<em>mesostatic</em>, or <em>hydrostatic</em>, depending upon the water-content. Such
conditions obtain for the most part only in denuded habitats.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>316. Succession by preventing weathering.</b> Reactions of this nature
occur especially in alpine and boreal regions, in the earlier stages of lichen-moss
successions. They are typical of igneous and metamorphic rocks in
which disintegration regularly precedes decomposition. The influence of the
vegetation is best seen in the lichen stages, where the crustose forms make a
compact layer, which diminishes the effect of the atmospheric factors producing
disintegration. In alpine regions especially, this protection is so perfect
that the crustose lichens may almost be regarded as the last stage of a
succession. There are no recorded observations which bear upon this point,
but it seems certain that the pioneer rock lichens, <em>Lecanora</em>, <em>Lecidea</em>, <em>Biatora</em>,
<em>Buellia</em>, and <em>Acarospora</em>, cover alpine rocks for decades, if not for centuries.
Ultimately, however, the slow decomposition of the rock surface beneath the
thallus has its effect. Tiny furrows and pockets are formed, in which water
accumulates to carry on its ceaseless work, and the compact crustose covering
is finally ruptured, permitting the entrance of foliose forms. The latter,
like the mosses, doubtless protect rock surfaces, especially those of the softer
rocks, in a slight degree against the influence of weathering, but this is more
than offset by their activity in hastening decomposition, and thus preparing
a field for invasion. Rocks and boulders (<em>petria</em>, <em>petrodia</em>, <em>phellia</em>) furnish
the best examples of this reaction; cliffs (<em>cremnia</em>) usually have a lichen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>covering on their faces, while the forces which produce disintegration operate
from above or below.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>317. Succession by binding aeolian soils.</b> Dunes (<em>thinia</em>) are classic examples
of the reaction of pioneer vegetation upon habitats of wind-borne
sand. The initial formations in such places consist exclusively of sand-binders,
plants with masses of fibrous roots, and usually also with strong
rootstalks, long, erect leaves, and a vigorous apical growth. They are almost
exclusively perennial grasses and sedges, possessing the unique property
of pushing up rapidly through a covering of sand. They react by
fixing the sand with their roots, thus preventing its blowing about, and also
by catching the shifting particles among their culms and leaves, forming a
tiny area of stabilization, in which the next generation can establish a foothold.
The gradual accumulation of vegetable detritus serves also to enrich
the soil, and makes possible the advent of species requiring better nourishment.
Blowouts (<em>anemia</em>) are almost exact duplicates of dunes in so
far as the steps of revegetation are concerned; while one is a hollow, and
the other a hill, in both the reaction operates upon a wind-swept slope.
Sand-hills (<em>amathia</em>) and deserts (<em>eremia</em>) show similar though less marked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>reactions, except where they exhibit typical inland dunes. Sand-binders,
while usually classed as xerophytic or halophytic, are in reality dissophytes.
Their roots grow more or less superficially in moist sand, and are morphologically
mesophytic while their leaves bear the stamp of xerophytes. The direction
of movement in successions of this kind is normally from xerophytes
to mesophytes, i. e., it is mesotropic. In sand-hills and deserts, the succession
operates wholly within the xerophytic (dissophytic) series. Along seacoasts,
the mesophytic terminus is regularly forest, except where forests
are remote, when it is grassland.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>318. Succession by reducing run-off and erosion.</b> All bare or denuded
habitats that have an appreciable slope are subject to erosion by surface
water. The rapidity and degree of erosion depend upon the amount of
rainfall, the inclination of the slope, and the structure of the surface soil.
Regions of excessive rainfall, even where the slope is slight, show great,
though somewhat uniform erosion; hill and mountain are deeply eroded
even when the rainfall is small. Slopes consisting of compact eugeogenous
soils, notwithstanding the marked adhesion of the particles, are much eroded
where the rainfall is great, on account of the excessive run-off. Porous
dysgeogenous soils, on the contrary, absorb most of the rainfall; the run-off
is small and erosion slight, except where the slope is great, a rare condition
on account of the imperfect cohesion of the particles. In compact soils, the
plants of the initial formations not merely break the impact of the raindrops,
but, what is much more important, they delay the downward movement
of the water, and produce numberless tiny streams. The delayed
water is largely absorbed by the soil, and the reduction of the run-off prevents
the formation of rills of sufficient size to cause erosion. As in dunes,
such plants are usually perennial grasses, though composites are frequent;
the root system is, however, more deeply seated, and a main or tap root is
often present. On sand and gravel slopes, the loose texture of the soil results
generally in the production of sand-binders with fibrous roots. Unlike
dunes, such slopes exhibit a large number of mats and rosettes with
tap-roots, which are effective in preventing the slipping or washing of the
sand, and run little danger of being covered, as is the case with duneformers.
In both instances, each pioneer plant serves as a center of comparative
stabilization for the establishment of its own offspring, and of such
invaders as find their way in. From the nature of these, slopes almost invariably
pass through grassland stages before finding their termini in thickets
or forests. Bad lands (<em>tiria</em>) furnish the most striking examples
of eroded habitats. The rainfall in the bad lands of Nebraska and South
Dakota is small (300 mm.); yet the steepness of the slope and the compactness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>of the soil render erosion so extreme that it is all but impossible for
plants to obtain a foothold. Their reaction is practically negligible, and the
vegetation passes the pioneer stages only in the relatively stable valleys.
Mountain slopes (<em>ancia</em>), and ridges and hills (<em>lophia</em>) are readily eroded
in new or denuded areas. This is especially true of hill and mountain regions
which have been stripped of their forest or thicket cover by fires,
lumbering, cultivation, or grazing. Where the erosion is slight, the resulting
succession may show initial xerophytic stages, or it may be completely
mesostatic. Excessively eroded habitats are xerostatic, as in the case of
bad lands, or, more frequently, they are mesotropic, passing first through
a long series of xerophytic formations. Sandbars (<em>cheradia</em>, <em>syrtidia</em>)
should be considered here, though they are eroded by currents and waves,
and not by run-off. They are fixed and built up by sand-binding grasses
and sedges, usually of a hydrophytic nature, and pass ultimately into mesophytic
forest.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>319. Succession by filling with silt and plant remains.</b> All aquatic habitats
into which silt, wash, or other detritus is borne by streams, currents,
floods, waves, or tides are slowly shallowed by the action of the water plants
present. These not only check the movement of the water, thus greatly decreasing
its carrying power, and causing the deposition of a part or all of its
load, but they also retain and fix the particles deposited. In accordance
with the rule, each plant becomes the center of a stabilizing area, which rises
faster than the rest of the floor, producing the well-known hummocks of
lagoons and swamps. All aquatics produce this reaction. It is more pronounced
in submerged and amphibious forms than in floating ones, and it
takes place more rapidly with greatly branched or dissected plants than with
others. In pools (<em>tiphia</em>) and lakes (<em>limnia</em>), debouching streams and surface
waters deposit their loads in consequence of the check exerted by the
still water and the marginal vegetation, and delta-like marshes are quickly
built up by filling. Springs (<em>crenia</em>) likewise form marshes where they gush
forth in sands, the removal of which is impeded by vegetation. The flood
plains and deltas of rivers show a similar reaction. The heavily laden flood
waters are checked by the vegetation of meadows and marshes, and deposit
most of their load. The banks of streams (<em>ochthia</em>) and of ditches (<em>taphria</em>)
are often built up in the same fashion by the action of the marginal vegetation
upon the current. The presence of marginal vegetation often determines
the checking or deflecting of the current in such a way as to initiate
meanders, while natural levees owe their origin to it, in part at least. Along
low seacoasts, waves and tides hasten the deposit of river-borne detritus,
causing the water to spread over the lowlands and form swamps. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>often throw back also the sediment that has been deposited in the sea, the
marsh vegetation acting as a filter in both cases. Successions of the kind
indicated above are regularly mesotropic. Where the soil is sandy, and the
filling-up process sufficiently great, or where salts or humus occur in excess,
xerophytic formations result. In certain cases, these successions appear to
be permanently hydrostatic, changing merely from floating or submerged to
amphibious conditions, but this is probably due to the slowness of the reaction.
As a rule, the accumulation of plant remains is relatively slight, and
plays an unimportant part in the reaction. In peat bogs and other extensive
swamps, the amount of organic matter is excessive, and plays an important
role in the building up of the swamp bed.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>320. Succession by enriching the soil.</b> This reaction occurs to some degree
in the great majority of all successions. The relatively insignificant
lichens and mosses produce this result upon the most barren rocks, while
the higher forms of later stages, grasses, herbs, shrubs, and trees, exhibit it
in marked progression. The reaction consists chiefly in the incorporation
of the decomposed remains of each generation and each stage in the soil. A
very important part is played by the mechanical and chemical action of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>roots in breaking up the soil particles, and in changing them into soluble
substances. Mycorrhizae, bacterial nodules, and especially soil bacteria play
a large part in increasing the nutrition-content of the soil, but the extent to
which they are effective in succession is completely unknown. The changes
in the color, texture, and food value of the soil in passing from the initial to
ultimate stages of a normal succession are well known, and have led many
to think them the efficient reactions of such successions. It seems almost
certain, however, that this is merely a concomitant, and that, even in anomalous
successions where facies replace each other without obvious reasons,
the reactions are concerned more with water-content, light, and humidity
than with the food-content of the soil.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>321. Succession by exhausting the soil.</b> This is a reaction not at all
understood as yet in nature. A number of phenomena, such as the “fairy
rings” of mushrooms and other fungi, the peripheral growth and central
decay of lichens, <em>Lecanora</em>, <em>Placodium</em>, <em>Parmelia</em>, and of matforming
grasses, such as <em>Muhlenbergia</em>, and the circular advance of the rootstalk
plants, indicate that certain plants at least withdraw much of the available
supply of some essential soil element, and are forced to move away from
the exhausted area. It is probable that the constant shifting of the individuals
of a formation year after year, a phenomenon to be discussed under
alternation, has some connection with this. It will be impossible to establish
such a relation, however, until the facts are exactly determined by the
method of quadrat statistics. So far as native formations are concerned,
there can not be the slightest question that prairies and forests have existed
over the same area for centuries without impoverishing the soil in the least
degree, a conclusion which is even more certain for the open vegetation of
deserts and plains. With culture formations, the case is quite different.
The exhaustion of the soil by continuous or intensive cultivation is a matter
of common experience in all lands settled for a long period. Calcium,
phosphorus, and nitrogen compounds especially are used up by crops, and
must be supplied artificially. The reason for this difference in reaction between
native and culture formations seems evident. In harvesting, not
merely the grain, but the stems and leaves, and in gardening often the root
also, are removed, so that the plant makes little or no return to the soil. In
nature, annual plants return to the ground every year all the solid matter
of roots, stems, leaves, and fruits, with the exception of the relatively small
number of seeds that germinate. Perennial herbs return everything but
the persistent underground parts. Shrubs and trees replace annually an immense
amount of material used in leaves and fruits, and sooner or later, by
the gradual decay of the individuals or by the destruction of the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>formation, they restore all that they have taken from the soil. This balance
is further maintained to an important degree by the activity of the roots,
which take from the deep-seated layers of the soil the crude materials necessary
for the formation of leaves and fruits. Upon the fall and decay of these,
their materials are incorporated with the upper layers of the formation floor,
from which they may be absorbed by the undergrowth, or find their way
again into the layers permeated by the tree roots. From the universal occurrence
of weeds in cultivated regions, the pioneers in impoverished or
exhausted fields are uniformly ruderal plants. As is well known, the seed
production and ecesis of these forms are such that they take possession
quickly and completely, while their demands upon the soil are of such a
nature that the most sterile field can rapidly be covered by a vigorous growth
of weeds. As indicated elsewhere, ruderal formations ultimately yield to
the native vegetation, though in regions so completely given over to culture
that native formations are lacking or remote, it is probable that successions
reach their final stage within the group of ruderal plants.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>322. Succession by the accumulation of humus.</b> This is the characteristic
reaction of peat bogs and cypress swamps (<em>oxodia</em>), in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>accumulation of vegetable matter is enormous. The plant remains decompose
slowly and incompletely under the water, giving rise to the various
humic acids. These possess remarkable antiseptic qualities, and have an
injurious effect upon protoplasm. They affect the absorption of water by
the root-hairs, though this is also influenced by poor aeration. The same
acids are found in practically all inland marshes and swamps, but the
quantity of decomposing vegetation in many is not great enough to produce
an efficient reaction. Formations of this type usually start as freshwater
swamps. The succession is apparently hydrostatic, but no thorough study
of its stages has as yet been made.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>323. Succession by modifying atmospheric factors.</b> All layered formations,
forests, thickets, many meadows and wastes, etc., show reactions of
this nature, and are in fact largely or exclusively determined by them. The
reaction is a complex one, though it is clear that light is the most efficient
of the modified factors, and that humidity, temperature, and wind, while
strongly affected, play subordinate parts. In normal successions, the effect
of shade, i. e., diffuse light, enters with the appearance of bushes or shrubs,
and becomes more and more pronounced in the ultimate forest stages. The
reaction is exerted chiefly by the facies, but the effect of this is to cause
increasing diffuseness in each successively lower layer, in direct ratio with
the increased branching and leaf expansion of the plants in the layer just
above. In the ultimate stage of many forests, especially where the facies are
reduced to one, the reaction of the primary layer is so intense as to preclude
all undergrowth. Anomalous successions often owe their origin to
the fact that certain trees react in such a way as to cause conditions in
which they produce seedlings with increasing difficulty, and thus offer a
field favorable to the ecesis of those species capable of enduring the dense
shade. Successions of this kind are almost invariably mesostatic, as it is
altogether exceptional that layered formations are either xerophytic or
hydrophytic.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>LAWS OF SUCCESSION</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>324.</b> The investigation of succession has so far been neither sufficiently
thorough nor systematic to permit the postulation of definite laws. Enough
has been done, however, to warrant the formulation of a number of rules,
which apply to the successions studied, and afford a convenient method for
the critical investigation of all successions upon the basis of initial causes,
and reactions. Warming has already brought together a few such rules,
and an attempt is here made to reduce the phenomena of succession, including
its causes and effects, to a tentative system. At present it is difficult to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>make a thoroughly satisfactory classification of such rules, and they are
here arranged in general conformity with the procedure in succession.</p>

      </dd>
      <dt>&#160;</dt>
      <dd>(4) The plants of the initial stages are normally algae and fungi, with minute spores, 
      composites, and grasses, which possess permobile fruits, or ruderal plants, on account of 
      their great seed production.

    <dl class='dl_1'>
      <dt>&#160;</dt>
      <dd>(1) All the migrants into a new, denuded, or greatly modified habitat are sorted by 
      ecesis into three groups: (1) those that are unable to germinate or grow, and soon die; 
      (2) those that grow normally under the conditions present; (3) those that pass through 
      one or more of the earlier stages in a dormant state to appear at a later stage of the 
      succession.

      <dt>&#160;</dt>
      <dd>(2) Wherever ruderal vegetation is present, it contributes a large number of the pioneer 
      species of each succession, on account of the thorough ecesis. In other regions this part 
      is played by subruderal native species.

      <dd>(2) The ultimate stage of a succession is determined by the dominant vegetation of the 
      region. Lichen formations are often ultimate in polar and niveal zones; grassland is the 
      final vegetation for plains and alpine stretches, and for much prairie, while forest is 
      the last stage for mesophytic midlands and lowlands, as well as for subalpine regions.
      </dd>
      <dt>&#160;</dt>
      <dd>(3) Grassland or forest is the usual terminus of a succession; they predominate in lands 
      physiographically mature.
      </dd>

      <dd>(4) The limit of a succession is determined in large part by the progressive increase in 
      occupation, which makes the entrance of invaders more and more difficult.
      </dd>
      <dt>&#160;</dt>
      <dd>(5) Stabilization proceeds radiately from the pioneer plants or masses. The movement of 
      offshoots is away from the parent mass, and the chances of ecesis are greatest near its 
      edges, in a narrow area in which the reaction is still felt, and the occupation is not 
      exclusive.

      <dd>(3) The number of species is small in the initial stages; it attains a maximum in 
      intermediate stages; and again decreases in the ultimate formation, on account of the 
      dominance of a few species.
      </dd>
      <dt>&#160;</dt>
      <dd>(4) The normal sequence of vegetation forms in succession is: (1) algae, fungi, mosses; 
      (2) annuals and biennials; (3) perennial herbs; (4) bushes and shrubs; (5) trees.
      </dd>
      <dt>&#160;</dt>
      <dd>(5) The number of species and of individuals in each stage increases constantly up to a 
      maximum, after which it gradually decreases before the forms of the next stage. The 
      interval between two maxima is occupied by a mixed formation.
      </dd>
      <dt>&#160;</dt>
      <dd><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>(6) A secondary succession does not begin with the initial stage of the primary one 
      which it replaces, but usually at a much later stage.
      </dd>
      <dt>&#160;</dt>
      <dd>(7) At present, successions are generally mesotropic, grassland and forest being the 
      ultimate stages, though many are xerostatic or hydrostatic. If erosion continue until the 
      sea level is reached, the ultimate vegetation of the globe will be hydrophytic. Should 
      the heat of the sun decrease greatly before this time, the last vegetation will be 
      xerophytic, i. e., crymophytic.
      </dd>
      <dt>&#160;</dt>
      <dd>(8) The operation of succession was essentially the same during the geological past as it 
      is to-day. From the nature of their vegetation forms, the record deals largely with the 
      ultimate stages of such successions.

<h4 class='c018'><em>CLASSIFICATION AND NOMENCLATURE</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>325. Basis.</b> New or denuded habitats arise the world over by the operation
of the same or similar causes, and they are revegetated in consequence
of the same reactions. Similar habitats produce similar successions. The
vegetation forms and their sequence are usually identical, and the genera
are frequently the same, or corresponding in regions not entirely unrelated.
The species are derived from the adjacent vegetation, and, except in alpine
and coast regions, are normally different. The primary groups of successions
are determined by essential identity of habitat or cause, e. g., aeolian
successions, erosion successions, burn successions, etc. When they have
been more generally investigated, it will be possible to distinguish subordinate
groups of successions, in which the degree of relationship is indicated
by the similarity of vegetation forms, the number of common genera, etc.
For example, burn successions in the Ural and in the Rocky mountains
show almost complete similarity in the matter of vegetation forms and their
sequence, and have the majority of their genera in common. A natural
classification of successions will divide them first of all into normal and
anomalous. The former fall into two classes, primary and secondary, and
these are subdivided into a number of groups, based upon the cause which
initiates the succession.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>326. Nomenclature.</b> The need of short distinctive names of international
value for plant formations is obvious; it has become imperative that
successions also should be distinguished critically and designated clearly.
From the very nature of the case, it is impossible to designate each formation
or succession by a single Greek or Latin term, as habitats of the same
character will show in different parts of the world a vegetation taxonomically
very different. It may some day be possible to use a binomial or trinomial
for this purpose, somewhat after the fashion of taxonomy, in which the
habitat name will represent the generic idea as applied to formations, and
a term drawn from the floristic impress the specific idea. Such an attempt
would be futile or valueless at the present time; it could not possibly meet
with success until there is more uniformity in the concept of the formation,
and until there has been much accurate and thorough investigation of actual
formations, a task as yet barely begun. At present, it seems most feasible
as well as scientific to designate all formations occupying similar habitats
by a name drawn from the character of the latter, such as a meadow formation,
<em>poium</em>, a forest formation, <em>hylium</em>, a desert formation, <em>eremium</em>, etc.
A particular formation is best designated by using the generic name of one
or two of its most important species in conjunction with its habitat term,
as <em>Spartina-Elymus-poium</em>, <em>Picea-Pinus-hylium</em>, <em>Cereus-Yucca-eremium</em>, etc.
Apparently a somewhat similar nomenclature is adapted to successions.
The cause which produces a new habitat may well furnish the basis for
the name of the general groups of successions, as <em>pyrium</em> (literally, a place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>or a habitat burned over), a burn succession, <em>tribium</em>, an erosion succession,
etc. A burn succession consists of a sequence of certain formations in one
part of the world, and of a series of quite different ones, floristically, in
another. A particular burn succession should be designated by using the
names of a characteristic facies of the initial and ultimate stages in connection
with the general term, e. g., <em>Bryum-Picea-pyrium</em>, etc. A trinomial
constructed in this way represents the desirable mean between definition and
brevity. Greater definiteness is possible only at the expense of brevity, while
to shorten the name would entirely destroy its precision. The following
classification of successions is proposed, based upon the plan outlined above.
The termination <em>-ium</em> (εῖον) has been used throughout in the construction
of names for successions, largely for reasons of euphony. If it should become
desirable to distinguish the names of formations and successions by
the termination, the locative suffix <em>-on</em> (-ών) should be used for the latter.
The terms given below would then be <em>hypson</em>, <em>rhyson</em>, <em>hedon</em>, <em>sphyron</em>,
<em>prochoson</em>, <em>pnoon</em>, <em>pagon</em>, <em>tribon</em>, <em>clyson</em>, <em>repon</em>, <em>olisthon</em>, <em>xerasion</em>, <em>theron</em>,
<em>broton</em>, <em>pyron</em>, <em>ecballon</em>, <em>camnon</em>, <em>ocheton</em>, <em>ardon</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>INVESTIGATION OF SUCCESSION</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>328. General rules.</b> The study of succession must proceed along two
fundamental lines of inquiry: it is necessary to investigate quantitatively
the physical factors of the initial stages and the reactions produced by the
subsequent stages. This should be done by automatic instruments for
humidity, light, temperature, and wind, in order that a continuous record
may be obtained. Water-content is taken daily or even less frequently, while
soil properties, and physiographic factors, altitude, slope, surface, and exposure
are determined once for all. It is equally needful to determine the
development and structure of each stage with particular reference to the
adjacent formations, to the stage that has just preceded, and the one that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>to follow. For this, the use of the permanent quadrat is imperative, as the
sequence and structure of the stages can be understood only by a minute
study of the shifting and rearrangement of the individuals. Permanent migration
circles are indispensable for tracing movement away from the pioneer
areas by which each stage reaches its maximum. Denuded quadrats are a
material aid in that they furnish important evidence with respect to migration
and ecesis, By means of them, it is possible to determine the probable development
of stages which reach back a decade or more into the past. In the examination
of successions, since cause and effect are so intimately connected in
each reaction, it is especially important that general and superficial observations
upon structure and sequence be replaced by precise records, and that
vague conjectures as to causes and reactions be supplanted by the accurate
determination of the physical factors which underlie them.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>329. Method of alternating stages.</b> The period of time through
which a primary succession operates is usually too great to make a complete
study possible within a single lifetime. Secondary successions run their
course much more quickly, and a decade will sometimes suffice for stabilization,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>though even here the period is normally longer. The longest and most
complex succession, however, may be accurately studied in a region, where
several examples of the same succession occur in different stages of development.
In the same region, the physical factors of one example of a
particular succession are essentially identical with those of another example
in the same stage. If one is in an initial stage, and the other in an intermediate
condition, the development of the former makes it possible to reestablish
more or less completely the life history of the latter. The same
connection may be made between intermediate and ultimate stages, and it
is thus possible to determine with considerable accuracy and within a few
years the sequence of stages in a succession that requires a century or more
for its complete development. In the Rocky mountains, gravel slides (talus
slopes) are remarkably frequent. They occur in all stages of development,
and the alternating slides of different ages furnish an almost perfect record
of this succession. This method lacks the absolute finality which can be
obtained by following a succession in one spot from its inception to final
stabilization, but it is alone feasible for long successions, i. e., those extending
over a score or more of years. When it comes to be universally recognized
as a plain duty for each investigator to leave an exact and complete record
in quadrat maps and quadrat photographs of the stages studied by him, it
will be a simple task for the botanists of one generation to finish the investigations
of succession begun by their predecessors.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>330. The relict method</b> of studying succession is next in importance
to the method of alternating areas. The two in fact are supplementary,
and should be used together whenever relicts are present. This method
is based upon the law of successive maxima, viz., the number of species and
of individuals in each stage constantly increases up to a certain maximum,
after which it gradually decreases before the forms of the next stage. In
accordance with this, secondary species usually disappear first, principal
species next, and facies last of all. There are notable exceptions to this, however,
and the safest plan is to use the relict method only when principal
species or facies are left as evidence. An additional reason for this is that
secondary species are more likely to be common to two or more formations.
In the majority of cases, the relict is not modified, and is readily recognized
as belonging properly to a previous stage. This is true of herbs in all the
stages of grassland, and in the initial ones of forest succession. The herbs
and shrubs of earlier stages, which persist in the final forest stages, are
necessarily modified, often in such a degree as to become distinct ecads, or
species. The facies of the stages which precede the ultimate forest are rarely
modified. The application of the relict method, together with the modification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>just described, is nicely illustrated by the balsam-spruce formation at
Minnehaha. Of the initial gravel slide stage, the relicts are <em>Vagnera stellata</em>
and <em>Galium boreale</em>, the one modified into <em>Vagnera leptopetala</em>, and the
other into <em>G. boreale hylocolum</em>. The thicket stage is represented by <em>Holodiscus
dumosa</em>, greatly changed in form and branching, and in the shape
and structure of the leaf. The most striking relict of the aspen formation
is the facies itself, <em>Populus tremuloides</em>. The tall slender trunks of dead
aspens are found in practically every balsam-spruce forest. In many places,
living trees are still found, with small, straggling crowns, which are vainly
trying to outgrow the surrounding conifers. Of the aspen undergrowth,
<em>Rosa sayii</em>, <em>Helianthella parryi</em>, <em>Frasera speciosa</em>, <em>Zygadenus elegans</em>, <em>Castilleia
confusa</em>, <em>Gentiana acuta</em>, and <em>Solidago orophila</em> remain more or less
modified by the diffuse light. It is still a question whether the aspen stage
passes directly into the balsam-spruce forest, or whether a pine forest intervenes.
The presence of both <em>Pinus ponderosa</em> and <em>P. flexilis</em>, which are
scattered more or less uniformly through the formation, furnishes strong
evidence for the latter view.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The lifetime of forest and thicket stages of successions is ascertained by
counting the annual rings of the stumps of facies. This is a perfectly feasible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>method for many woodland formations where stumps already abound or
where a fire has occurred, and it is but rarely necessary to cut down trees
for this purpose. When trees or shrubs are present as relicts, the same
method is used to determine the length of time taken by the development of
the corresponding stages.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE STRUCTURE OF THE FORMATION</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>331.</b> Since all the structures exhibited by formations, such as zones, layers,
consocies, etc., are to be referred to zonation or alternation, these principles
are first considered in detail. This, then, constitutes the basis for a consideration
of the structure of a normal formation, with special reference to
the different parts that compose it. The investigation of formational structure,
since the latter is the result of aggregation, invasion, and succession, is
accomplished by instruments, quadrats, etc., in the manner already indicated
under development, and no further discussion of it is necessary here.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ZONATION</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>332. Concept.</b> The recognition of vegetation zones dates from Tournefort<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c017'><sup>[40]</sup></a>,
who found that, while the plants of Armenia occupied the foot of
Mount Ararat, the vegetation of the slopes above contained many species of
southern Europe. Still higher appeared a flora similar to that of Sweden,
and on the summit grew arctic plants, such as those of Lapland.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the historical summary shows, the concept of zonation is the oldest in
phytogeography. Notwithstanding this, it has never been clearly defined,
nor has there been any detailed investigation of the phenomenon itself, or
of the causes which produce it. Zones are so common, and often so clearly
marked, that they invite study, but no serious attempt has heretofore been
made to analyze zonation, or to formulate a definite method of investigating
it. Zonation is the practically universal response of plants to the quantitative
distribution of physical factors in nature. In almost all habitats, one or
more of the physical factors present decreases gradually in passing away
from the point of greatest intensity. The result is that the plants of the
habitat arrange themselves in belts about this point, their position being determined
by their relation to the factor concerned. Close investigation will
show that there is hardly a formation that is entirely without zonation,
though in many cases the zones are incomplete or obscure for various reasons.
Zonation is as characteristic of vegetation as a whole as it is of its unit,
the formation, a fact long ago recognized in temperature zones. A continental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>climate, however, often results in the interruption of these, with the
consequence that these belts of vegetation are not always continuous.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>CAUSES OF ZONATION</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>333. Growth.</b> The causes that produce zones are either biological or
physical: the first have to do with some characteristic of the plant, the
second with the physical features of the habitat. Biological causes arise from
the method of growth, from the manner of dissemination, or from the reaction
of the species upon the habitat. The formation of circles as a result
of radial growth is a well-known occurrence with certain plants, but it is
much more common than is supposed. In the case of agarics, this phenomenon
has long been known under the name of “fairy-rings.” It is found in
a large number of moulds, and is characteristic of early stages of the mycelium
of the powdery mildews. It occurs in nearly all maculicole fungi, and
is exhibited by certain xylogenous fungi, such as <em>Hysterographium</em>. Among
the foliose lichens, it is a common occurrence with the rock forms of
<em>Parmelia</em>, <em>Placodium</em>, <em>Physcia</em>, and <em>Lecanora</em>, and with the earth forms of
<em>Parmelia</em> and <em>Peltigera</em>. The thalloid liverworts show a similar radial
growth. The flowering plants, and many mosses also, furnish good examples
of this sort of growth in those species which simulate the form of the mycelium
or thallus. These are the species that form mats, turfs, or carpets.
Alpine mat formers, such as <em>Silene acaulis</em>, <em>Paronychia pulvinata</em>, <em>Arenaria
sajanesis</em>, etc., are typical examples. Xerophytic, turf-forming species of
<em>Muhlenbergia</em>, <em>Sporobolus</em>, <em>Bouteloua</em>, <em>Festuca</em>, <em>Poa</em>, and other grasses form
striking ring-like mats, while creeping species of <em>Euphorbia</em>, <em>Portulaca</em>,
<em>Amarantus</em>, etc., produce circular areas. Rosettes, bunch-grasses, and many
ordinary rootstalk plants spread rapidly by runners and rhizomes. The
direction of growth is often indeterminate in these also, and is in consequence
more or less bilateral or unilateral. Growth results in zonation only when
the older central portions of the individual or mass die away, leaving an
ever-widening belt of younger plants or parts. This phenomenon is doubtless
due in part to the greater age of the central portion, but seems to arise
chiefly from the demands made by the young and actively growing parts
upon the water of the soil. There may possibly be an exhaustion of nutritive
content, as in the case of the fungi, but this seems improbable for the reason
that young plants of the same and other species thrive in these areas. It
must not be inferred that these miniature growth zones increase in size until
they pass into zones of formations. Growth contributes its share to the
production of these, but there is no genetic connection between a tiny plant
zone and a zone of vegetation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Radial and bilateral growth play an important part in formational zones
in so far as they are related to migration. The growth of the runner or
rhizome itself is a very effective means of dissemination, while the seeding
of the plants thus carried away from the central mass is most effective at the
edge of the newly occupied area. This holds with equal force for plants
with a mycelium or a thallus. The circular area becomes larger year by year.
Sooner or later, the younger, more vigorous, and more completely occupied
circumference passes into a more or less complete zone. This will result
from the reaction of the central individuals upon the habitat, so that they
are readily displaced by invaders, or from their increasing senility and
dying out, or from the invasion of forms which seed more abundantly and
successfully. This result will only be the more marked if the radiating
migrants reach a belt of ground especially favorable to their ecesis. In this
connection it must be carefully noted that vegetation pressure, before which
weaker plants are generally supposed to flee, or by which they are thought
to be forced out into less desirable situations, is little more than a fanciful
term for radial growth and migration. It has been shown under invasion
that disseminules move into vegetation masses, as well as away from them,
the outward movement alone being conspicuous, because it is only at the
margin and beyond that they find the necessary water and light for growth.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>334. Reactions.</b> Certain reactions of plants upon habitats produce zonation.
The zones of fungi are doubtless caused by the exhaustion of the
organic matter present, while in lichens and mosses the decrease in nutritive
content has something to do with the disappearance of the central mass. In
the mats of flowering plants, the connection is much less certain. The reaction
of a forest or thicket, or even of a tall herbaceous layer, is an extremely
important factor in the production of zonation. The factor chiefly
concerned here is light. Its intensity is greatest at the edge of the formation
and just below the primary layer; the light becomes increasingly diffuse
toward the center of the forest, and toward the ground. In response to this,
both lateral and vertical zones appear. The former are more or less incomplete,
and are only in part due to differences in illumination. The vertical
zones or layers are characteristic of forest and thickets, and are caused
directly by differences in light intensity.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>335. Physical factors.</b> The physical causes of zonation are by far the
most important. They arise from differences in temperature, water, and
light. In the large, temperature differences are the most important, producing
the great zones of vegetation. In a particular region or habitat,
variations of water-content and humidity are controlling, while light, as
shown above, is important in the reactions of forest and thicket. Physical
factors produce zonation in a habitat or a series of habitats, when there is
either a gradual and cumulative, or an abrupt change in their intensity.
Gradual, slight changes are typical of single habitats; abrupt, marked
changes of a series of habitats. This modification of a decisive factor tends
to operate in all directions from the place of greatest intensity, producing
a characteristic symmetry of the habitat with reference to the factor concerned.
If the area of greatest amount is linear, the shading-out will take
place in two directions, and the symmetry will be bilateral, a condition well
illustrated by rivers. On the other hand, a central intense area will shade
out in all directions, giving rise to radial symmetry, as in ponds, lakes, etc.
The essential connection between these is evident where a stream broadens
into a lake, or the latter is the source of a stream, where a mountain ridge
breaks up into isolated peaks, or where a peninsula or landspit is cut into
islands. The line that connects the points of accumulated or abrupt change
in the symmetry is a stress line or <em>ecotone</em>. Ecotones are well-marked between
formations, particularly where the medium changes; they are less
distinct within formations. It is obvious that an ecotone separates two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>different series of zones in the one case, and merely two distinct zones in the
other.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>336. Physiographic symmetry.</b> The physical symmetry of a habitat
depends upon the distribution of water in it, and this is profoundly affected
by the soil and the physiography. The influence of precipitation is slight or
lacking, as it is nearly uniform throughout the habitat; the effects of wind
and humidity are more localized. Differences of soil rarely obtain within
a single habitat, though often occurring in a zoned series. The strikingly
zonal structure or arrangement of habitats is nearly always due to differences
in water-content produced by physiographic factors, slope, exposure,
surface, and altitude. The effect of these upon water-content and humidity
is obvious. Wherever appreciable physiographic differences occur, there
will be central areas of excess and deficiency in water-content, between
which there is a symmetrical modification of this factor. Peaks are typical
examples of areas of deficiency, lakes and oceans of areas of excess. When
these areas are extreme and close to each other, the resulting zonation will be
marked; when they are moderate, particularly if they are widely separated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>the zones produced are obscure. Asymmetry of a habitat or a region practically
does not exist. Central areas of excess and deficiency may be very
large and in consequence fail to seem symmetrical, or the space between
them so great that the symmetry is not conspicuous, but they are everywhere
present, acting as foci for the intervening areas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The response of vegetation to habitat is so intimate that physiographic
symmetry everywhere produces vegetational symmetry, which finds its ready
expression in plant zones. The reaction of vegetation upon habitat causes
biological symmetry, typical of growth zones and light zones. From these
facts it is clear that zonation will be regularly characteristic of the vegetative
covering. The zonal arrangement of formations is usually very evident;
the zones of a formation are often obscured, or, where the latter occupies
a uniform central area of excess or deficiency, they are rudimentary or lacking,
as in shallow ponds. Zones are frequently imperfect, though rarely
entirely absent in new soils, such as talus. They are rendered obscure in
several ways. In the initial stages of a succession, as well as in the transitions
between the various stages, the plant population is so scattered, so
transient, or so dense as to respond not at all to a degree of symmetry
which produces marked zonation in later formations. The alternation of
conspicuous species not only causes great interruption of zones, but often
also completely conceals the zonation of other species, such as the grasses,
which, though of more importance in the formation, have a lower habit of
growth. Furthermore, the ecotones of one factor may run at right angles to
those of another, and the resulting series of zones mutually obscure each
other. Finally, such a physiographic feature as a hill may have its symmetry
interrupted by ridges or ravines, which deflect the zones downward
or upward, or cause them to disappear altogether, while the shallows or
depths of a pond or lake may have the same effect. An entire absence of
zones, i. e., azonation, is exceptional in vegetation. Almost all cases that
seem to exhibit it may be shown by careful examination to arise in one of the
several ways indicated above.</p>

<h4 class='c018'><em>KINDS OF ZONATION</em></h4>

<p class='c016'><b>337.</b> Two kinds of zonation are distinguished with reference to the
direction in which the controlling factor changes. When this is horizontal,
as with water-content and temperature, zonation will be lateral; when it is
vertical, as in the case of light, the zonation is vertical. There exists an
intimate connection between the two in forests, where the secondary layer
of small trees and shrubs is continuous with a belt of trees and shrubs around
the central nucleus, and the lower layers of bushes and herbaceous plants
with similar zones still further out. This connection doubtless arises from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>the fact that conditions are unfavorable to the facies, outside of the nucleus
as well as beneath it. Floristically, each layer and its corresponding zone
are distinct, as the one consists of shade, the other of sun species. Lateral
zonation is radial when the habitat or physiographic feature is more or less
circular in form, and it is bilateral, when the latter is elongated or linear.
Vertical zonation is unilateral.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>338. Radial zonation</b> is regularly characteristic of elevations and depressions.
From the form of the earth, it reaches its larger expression in
the girdles of vegetation corresponding to the zones of temperature. The
zones of mountain peaks are likewise due largely to temperature, though
humidity is a very important factor also. Mountain zones are normally
quite perfect. The zonation of islands, hills, etc., is due to water-content.
In the former, the zones are usually quite regular and complete; in the
latter, they are often incomplete or obscured. Prairies and steppes are not
zoned as units, but are complexes of more or less zonal hills and ridges.
Ponds, lakes, and seas regularly exhibit complete zones, except in those
shallow ponds where the depth is so slight that what is ordinarily a marginal
zone is able to extend over the entire bottom. The line between an elevation
and a depression, i. e., the edge of the water level, is the most sharply
defined of all ecotones. It separates two series of zones, each of which constitutes
a formation. One of these is regularly hydrophytic, the other is
usually mesophytic. The line between the two can rarely be drawn at the
water’s edge, as this is not a constant, owing to waves, tides, or periodical
rise and fall. There is in consequence a more or less variable transition
zone of amphibious plants, which are, however, to be referred to the hydrophytic
formation. Nearly all forest formations serve as a center about which
are arranged several somewhat complete zones. As a rule, these merge
into a single heterogeneous zone of thickets.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>339. Bilateral zonation</b> differs from radial only in as much as it deals
with linear elevations and depressions instead of circular ones. With this
difference, the zones of ranges and ridges correspond exactly to those of
peaks and hills, while the same relation is evident between the zones of
streams, and of lakes and ponds. The ecotones are identical except as to
form; they are linear in the one and circular in the other. Incompleteness is
more frequently found in bilateral zonation, though this is a question of
distance or extent, rather than one of symmetry.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>340. Vertical zonation</b> is peculiar in that there is no primary ecotone
present, on either side of which zones arrange themselves with reference to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>the factor concerned. This arises from the fact that the controlling factor
is light, which impinges upon the habitat in such manner as to shade out in
but one direction, i. e., downward. Vertical zones appear in bodies of
water, on account of the absorption of light by the water. In a general way,
it is possible to distinguish bottom, plancton, and surface zones, consisting
almost wholly of algae. There is little question that minor zones exist, especially
in lakes and seas, but these await further investigation. The most
characteristic vertical zones occur in forests, where the primary layer of trees
acts as a screen. The density of this screen determines the number of zones
found beneath it. In extreme cases the foliage is so dense that the light
beneath is insufficient even for mosses and lichens. As a rule, however,
there will be one or more zones present. In an ordinary deciduous forest,
the layers below the facies are five or six in number: (1) a secondary layer
of small trees and shrubs, (2) a tertiary layer of bushes, (3) an upper
herbaceous layer of tall herbs, (4) a middle herbaceous layer, (5) a lower
herbaceous layer, (6) a ground layer of mosses, lichens, other fungi, and
algae. The upper layers are often discontinuous, the lower ones are more
and more continuous. As a forest becomes denser, its layers disappear from
the upper downward, the ground layer always being the last to disappear
because of its ability to grow in very diffuse light. A vertically zoned formation
shows a complex series of reactions. The primary layer determines
the amount of heat, light, water, wind, etc., for the subordinate layers in
general. Each of these layers then further determines the amount for those
below it, the ground layer being subject in some degree to the control of
every layer above it. This accounts probably for the definiteness and permanence
of this layer. The degree to which the lower layers influence the
upper by reacting upon the habitat is not known. It is evident that this influence
must be considerable by virtue of their control of the water supply in
the upper soil strata, by virtue of their transpiration, their decomposition, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ecotone between two formations is never a sharp line, but it is an
area of varying width. The edge of this area which is contiguous to one
formation marks the limit for species of the other. Both formations disappear
in this transition zone, but in opposite directions. The overlapping
which produces such zones arises from the fact that the physical factors
tend to approach each other at the line of contact between formations, and
that many species are more or less adjustable to conditions not too dissimilar.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>341. Vegetation zones.</b> As a fundamental expression of progressive
change in the amount of heat and water, zonation is the most important
feature of vegetation. It constitutes the sole basis for the division of continental
as well as insular vegetation. The continent of North America
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>furnishes striking proof of the truth of this. Conforming to the gradual
decrease of temperature and water-content northward, three primary belts
of vegetation stretch across the continent from east to west. These are
forest, grassland, and polar desert. The first is further divided into the
secondary zones of broad-leaved evergreen, deciduous, and needle-leaved
forests. At right angles to this temperature-water symmetry lies a symmetry
due to water alone, in accordance with which forest belts touch the oceans,
but give way in the interior to grasslands, and these to deserts. It is at
once evident that the mutual interruption of these two series of zones has
produced the primary features of North America vegetation, i. e., tropical
forests where heat and water are excessive, deserts where either is unusually
deficient, grassland when one is low, the other moderate, and deciduous and
coniferous forests, where the water-content is as least moderate and the
temperature not too low. Such a simple yet fundamental division has been
modified, however, by the disturbing effect which three continental mountain
systems have had upon humidity and upon temperature symmetry. The
two are intimately interwoven. The lowering of temperature due to altitude
produces the precipitation of the wind-borne moisture upon those slopes
which look toward the quarter from which the prevailing winds blow. A
mountain range thus makes an abrupt change in the symmetry, and renders
impossible the gradual change from forest to grassland and desert. The
Appalachian system is not sufficiently high to produce a pronounced effect,
and forests extend far beyond it into the interior before passing into prairies
and plains. On the other hand, the influence of the Rocky mountains and the
Sierra Nevada is very marked. The latter rise to a great height relatively
near the coast, and condense upon their western slopes nearly all of the
moisture brought from the Pacific. The Rocky mountains have the same
effect upon the much drier winds that blow from the east, and the two systems
in consequence enclose a parched desert. This series of major zones
thus becomes, starting at the east, forest, grassland, desert, and forest, instead
of the more symmetrical series, forest, grassland, desert, grassland, forest,
which would prevail were it not for these barriers. This actual series of
major zones undergoes further interruption by the action of these mountain
systems in deflecting northern isotherms far to the south. This action is
greatest in the high ranges, the Rocky mountains and the Sierras, and least
in the lower Appalachians. Its result is to carry the polar deserts of the
north far southward along the crests of the mountains, and to extend the
boreal coniferous forests much further south along their slopes. In the
Appalachians, this means no more than the extension of a long tongue of
conifers into the mass of deciduous forests, and the occasional appearance
of an isolated peak. In the western ranges, it produces two symmetrical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>series of minor mountain zones, forest, alpine grassland or desert, and
forest, to say nothing of the foot-hill and timber-line zones of thicket.</p>

<p class='c007'>There seems to be no good reason for distinguishing the zones of mountains
as regions. The term itself is inapplicable, as it has no reference to
zonation, and is used much more frequently as a term of general application.
Its use tends to obscure also the essential identity of the so-called vertical
zones of mountains with the major continental zones, an identity which can
not be insisted upon too strongly. For the sake of clearness, it is important
to distinguish all belts of vegetation as zones, though it is evident that these
are not all of the same rank. The following division of the vegetation of
North America is based upon the fundamental principles of continental symmetry
and the community of continental and mountain zones.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ALTERNATION</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>342. Concept.</b> The term alternation is used to designate that phenomenon
of vegetation, in which a formation recurs at different places in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>region, or a species at separate points in a formation. Although it is a fundamental
feature of vegetation, it has been recognized but recently.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c017'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Alternation is the response of vegetation to the heterogeneity of the surface
of the earth. It is in sharp contrast to zonation, inasmuch as it is directly
caused by asymmetry in the topography. In consequence, it deals with the
subdivisions of zones, arising from physical differences within the symmetrical
area. It deals with vegetation areas of every rank below that of
major zone, with the habitat and geographical areas of species, and, in a
certain way, with the correspondence of vicarious genera. The breaking up
of vegetation into formations is a striking example of alternation. The same
phenomenon occurs in every formation, producing consocies and minor
plant groups, and everywhere giving variation to its surface and structure.
The essential idea involved in this principle is the recurrence of like formations,
consocies, or groups, which are more or less separated by formations,
consocies, or groups differing from them. It is an exact expression
of the primary law of association that heterogeneity of structure varies
directly as the extent and complexity of the habitat, or the series of habitats.
Vegetation is made up of what are superficially homogeneous formations,
but upon analysis these are seen to contain consocies. The latter, though
more uniform than formations, break up into groups, each of which still
shows a characteristic heterogeneity arising from the varying number and
arrangement of its constituent species.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>343. Causes.</b> The primary cause of alternation is physical asymmetry,
which is everywhere present within the symmetrical areas which produce
zones. This is influenced so strongly, however, by migration and plant
competition (<em>phyteris</em>) that the consideration of this subject will gain in
clearness if these are treated as separate causes. The essential relation between
them must not be lost sight of, however. Migration carries disseminules
into all, or only some of the different areas of a formation, or into
different formations, with little respect to the physical nature of these. The
physical character of these asymmetrical areas determines that some of
these plants shall be established in one series of places, and some in another,
while the competition between the individuals in the various areas determines
the numerical value of each species as well as its persistence. These three
causes are invariably present in the production of alternating areas, and
originally, i. e., in new or denuded soils, the sequence is constant, viz., migration,
ecesis in asymmetrical areas, and competition.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>With respect to the different portions of an asymmetrical area, migration
will have one of three effects: (1) it will carry disseminules into both
favorable and unfavorable areas, (2) into favorable ones only, or (3) into
unfavorable ones alone. From the radial nature of migration, the first case is
far the most frequent; it is typical of sporostrotes, and the highly specialized
spermatostrotes and carpostrotes. The effect of migration is uniform here,
and alternation arises in consequence of the selective power of ecesis. It is
evident that migration does not have an even indirect effect, when the disseminules
are carried into none but unfavorable situations. Where the movement
is into favorable places alone, alternation is the immediate result. The
intermittent operation of migration and the presence of barriers are responsible
for the absence of plants in situations favorable to them, and in
consequence bring about a certain alternation between corresponding species.</p>

<p class='c007'>The selective operation of physical factors upon the disseminules carried
into the different parts of an asymmetrical area is the usual cause of alternation.
Asymmetry alone is universal within the more conspicuous structures
termed zones, down to the smallest areas which a group of plants can occupy.
The difference between contiguous areas, particularly within the same habitat,
is often small. It sometimes seems inefficient in the initial stages of a succession
when a single species is present, but even in extreme cases its effect
will be recognizable in the size and density of the individuals. Asymmetry
is clearly evident in vegetation where two symmetrical series cross each other,
or when a symmetry is interrupted by barrier-like elevations or depressions.
Within formations, it arises from differences, often very slight, in slope,
exposure, elevation, from irregularities of surface, differences in soil structure,
or composition, in the amount of cover, and in the reactions of the living
plants. At the last point, it is in direct connection with plant competition.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>344. Competition.</b> Much uncertainty, as well as diversity of opinion,
seems still to exist in regard to the precise nature of the competition between
plants that occupy the same area. It has long been admitted that the
phrase, “struggle for existence,” is true of this relation only in the most
figurative sense, but the feeling still prevails that, since plants live in associations,
there must be something mysterious and vitalistic in their relation.
No one has been able to discover anything of this nature, but nevertheless
the impression remains. Such a direct relation exists only between
parasites, epiphytes, and lianes, and the plants which serve to nourish
or support them. In the case of plants growing on the same stratum, actual
competition between plant and plant does not occur. One individual can
affect another only in as much as it changes the physical factors that influence
the latter. Competition is a question of the reaction of a plant upon
the physical factors which encompass it, and of the effect of these modified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>factors upon the adjacent plants. In the exact sense, two plants do not compete
with each other as long as the water-content and nutrition, the heat
and light are in excess of the needs of both. The moment, however, that
the roots of one enter the area from which the other draws its water supply,
or the foliage of one begins to overshade the leaves of the other, the reaction
of the former modifies unfavorably the factors controlling the latter, and
competition is at once initiated. The same relation exists throughout the
process; the stronger, taller, the more branched, or the better rooted plant
reacts upon the habitat, and the latter immediately exerts an unfavorable
effect upon the weaker, shorter, less branched, or more poorly rooted plant.
This action of plant upon habitat and of habitat upon plant is cumulative,
however. An increase in the leaf surface of a plant not merely reduces the
amount of light and heat available for the plant near it or beneath it, but
it also renders necessary the absorption of more water and other nutritive
material, and correspondingly decreases the amount available. The inevitable
result is that the successful individual prospers more and more, while
the less successful one loses ground in the same degree. As a consequence,
the latter disappears entirely, or it is handicapped to such an extent that it
fails to produce seeds, or these are reduced in number or vitality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Competition in vegetation furnishes few instances as simple as the above,
but this will serve to make clear the simplest case of ordinary competition,
i. e., that in which the individuals belong to a single species. The various
individuals of one species which grow together in a patch show relatively
slight differences, in height, width, leaf expanse, or root surface. Still, some
will have the largest surfaces for the impact of water, heat, and light, while
others will have the smallest; the majority, perhaps, will occupy different
places between the extremes. The former will receive more than their share
of one or more factors. The reaction thus produced will operate upon the
plants subject to it inversely as the amount of surface impinged upon. The
usual expression of such competition is seen in the great variation in height,
branching, etc., of the different individuals, and in the inability of many to
produce flowers. This is particularly true of annuals, and of perennials of
the same generation. In the competition between parents and offspring of
the same perennial species, the former usually have so much the advantage
that the younger plants are often unable to thrive or even germinate, and
disappear, leaving a free space beneath and about the stronger parents.
This illustrates the primary law of competition, viz., that this is closest
when the individuals are most similar. Similar individuals make nearly the
same demands upon the habitat, and adjust themselves least readily to their
mutual reactions. The more unlike plants are, the greater the difference in
their needs, and some are able to adjust themselves to the reactions of others
with little or no disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>In accordance with the above principles, the competition is closer between
species of like form than between those that are dissimilar. This similarity
must be one of vegetation or habitat form, not one of systematic position.
The latter is in fact of no significance, except where there is a certain correspondence
between the two. Leaf, stem, and root characters determine the
outcome, and those species most alike in these features will be in close competition,
regardless of their taxonomic similarity or dissimilarity. This is as
conclusive of the competition between the species of the same genus as it is
between those belonging to genera of widely separated families. From this
may be deduced a second principle of competition, viz., the closeness of the
competition between the individuals of different species varies directly with
their similarity in vegetation or habitat form. This principle is of primary
importance in the competition which arises between occupants and invaders
in the different stages of succession. Those invading species that show the
greatest resemblance to occupants in leaf, stem, and root form experience the
greatest difficulty in establishing themselves. The species, on the contrary,
which are so unlike the occupants that they come in at a clear advantage or
disadvantage, establish themselves readily, in the one case as a result of the
reaction, in the other by taking a subordinate position. This principle lies
at the base of the changes in succession which give a peculiar stamp to each
stage. A reaction sufficient to bring about the disappearance of one stage
can be produced only by the entrance of invaders so different in form as to
materially or entirely change the impress of the formation. Stabilization
results when the entrance of invaders of such form as to exert an efficient
reaction is no longer possible. In forests, while many vegetation forms can
still enter, none of these produce a reaction sufficient to place the trees at a
disadvantage, and the ultimate forest stage, though it may change in composition,
can not be displaced by another.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is obvious that the vegetation forms and habitat forms of associated
species are of fundamental importance in determining the course and result
of competition. Identity of vegetation form regularly produces close competition,
and the consequent numerical reduction or disappearance of one or
more species. Dissimilarity, on the other hand, tends to eliminate competition,
and to preserve the advantage of the superior form. Species of trees
compete sharply with each other when found together; the same is true of
shrubs, or rosettes, etc. The relation of the shrubs to the trees, or of the
rosettes to the shrubs of a formation is one of subordination rather than of
competition. The matter of height and width often enters here also to such
a degree that the tallest herbs compete with the bushes and shrubs, and
rosettes with mats or grasses. The amount and disposition of the leaf surface
are decisive factors in the competition between species of the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>vegetation form, in so far as this is governed by light. In those plants in
which the leaves are usually erect, notably the grasses and sedges, the competition
between the aerial parts is relatively slight, and the result is determined
by the reactions of the underground stems and roots.</p>

<p class='c007'>The position of the competing individuals is of the greatest importance.
The distance between the plants affects directly the degree of competition,
while their arrangement, whether in groups according to species or singly,
exerts a marked influence by determining that the contest shall be between
like forms, or unlike forms. Position is controlled primarily by the relation
existing between seed-production and dissemination. It is of course influenced
in large measure by the initial position taken by the invaders into a
nudate area, but this is itself a result of the same phenomena. The individuals
of species with great seed-production and little or no mobility
usually occur in dense stands. In these, the competition is fierce, for the
two reasons of similarity and density, and the result is that the plants fall
far below the normal in height and width. This is an extreme example of
the group arrangement. When the seed-production is small, the mobility
may be great or little without seriously affecting the result. The individuals
of a species of this kind will be scattered among those of other species, and
the closeness of competition will depend largely upon the similarity existing
between the two. The arrangement in such cases is sparse. A species with
great seed-production and great mobility usually shows both kinds of arrangement,
the position of the individuals and the competition between them
varying accordingly. This is due to the intermittent action of distributing
agents, making it possible for the seeds to fall directly to the ground during
the times that winds, etc., are absent. The three types of arrangement indicated
above are termed gregarious, copious, and gregario-copious. They
furnish the basis for the investigation of abundance which deals essentially
with the number and arrangement of the individuals of competing species.
The effect of distance, i. e., the interval between individuals, upon competition
is fundamental. The competition increases as the interval diminishes,
and the reverse.</p>

<p class='c007'>The view here advanced, i. e., that competition is purely physical in nature,
renders untenable the current conceptions of vegetation pressure, occupation,
etc. Masses of vegetation are thought to force the weaker species toward
the edge, thus initiating an outward or forward pressure. As has been
shown above, no such phenomenon occurs in vegetation. This movement
is nothing but simple migration, followed by ecesis, and has no connection
with “weaker” species, or the development of a vital pressure. The direction
taken by the migrating disseminules is essentially indeterminate. Migration
seems to be outward, or away from the mass, merely because the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>ecesis is greater at the edge, where the increased dissimilarity between plant
forms diminishes the competition. The actual movement is outward, but it
takes place through the normal operation of competition. In this connection,
it should be pointed out that the common view that plants require room is
inexact, if not erroneous. This is difficult of proof, as it is impossible to distinguish
room as such from the factors normally present, light, heat, water,
and nutrient salts, but it seems obvious that the available amounts of these
will determine the space occupied by a plant, irrespective of the room adjacent
plants may allow it. The explanation of competition upon physical
grounds likewise invalidates the view that plants possess spheres of influence
other than the areas within which they exert a demonstrable reaction upon
the physical factors present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Competition plays a very important role in alternation. It produces minor
examples of alternation in the physical units of an asymmetrical series. Its
greatest influence, however, is exerted in modifying the effects of asymmetry.
The reaction of occupants emphasizes or reduces the effect of asymmetry,
and has a corresponding action upon alternation. This result of competition
is typical of succession, in which the sequence of stages arises from
the interaction of occupant and invader.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>345. Kinds of alternation.</b> Alternation involves two ideas, viz., the alternation
of different species or formations with each other, and the alternation
of the same species or formation in similar but separate situations. This
is the evident result of asymmetry, in response to which contiguous areas
are dissimilar and remote ones often similar. Individuals of the same species
or examples of the same formation may be said to alternate between two or
more similar situations, while different species or formations are said to alternate
<em>with</em> each other, occurring usually in situations different in character.
From the nature of alternation, the two phenomena are invariably
found together.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is possible to distinguish three kinds of alternation: (1) of a formation,
consocies, layer, facies, or species in similar situations; (2) of similar or
corresponding formations, species, etc., in similar situations; (3) of facies
and other species with respect to number. The last two are merely variations
of the first, arising out of slight differences in the physical factors of
the alternating areas, the adjacent flora, or the course of competition. The
alternation of different examples of the same formation is a significant feature
of greatly diversified areas, such as mountains. It is naturally much
less characteristic of lands physiographically more uniform. A xerophytic
formation will alternate from ridge to ridge, a mesophytic formation between
the intermediate valleys; aquatic vegetation will alternate from pond to pond,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>or stream to stream. The appearance of new or denuded soils upon which
successions establish themselves is the most important cause of the alternation
of formations. The weathering of rocks in different areas of the same
region produces in each a sequence of similar or identical formations. The
same statement is true in general of other causes of succession, such as erosion,
flooding, burning, cultivation, etc., wherever they operate upon areas
physically similar and surrounded by the same type of vegetation. The areas
of more or less heterogeneous formations characterized by major physical
differences are occupied by consocies. In an extensive formation, the
same consocies alternates from one to another of these areas that are similar.
When the formation is interrupted and occurs here and there in separate
examples, a consocies often alternates from one to another of these.
A consocies regularly derives its character from the fact that one or more
of the facies of the formation is more intimately connected with certain
areas of the latter than with others. This explains why the alternations of
consocies and facies are usually identical. Layers sometimes alternate between
different examples of the same forest or thicket formation, when they
are suppressed in some by the diffuseness of the light.</p>

<p class='c007'>The alternation of species is a typical feature of formations; it is absent
only in those rare cases where the latter consist of a single species. The
areas of a habitat which show minor physical or historical (i. e., competitive)
differences are occupied by groups of individuals belonging to one or
more species responsive to these differences. Each of these groups will recur
in all areas essentially similar, the intervals being occupied of course by
slightly different groups. Such groups are constituted by gregarious or copious
species of restricted adjustability. Sparse plants likewise alternate, but
they necessarily play a much less conspicuous part. In habitats not too heterogeneous,
a large number of species are sufficiently adjustable to the slight
differences so that they occur throughout the formation. Often, to be sure,
they show a characteristic response, expressed in the size or number. This is
illustrated by the facies and many of the principal species of the prairie formation.
<em>Festuca</em>, <em>Koelera</em>, <em>Panicum</em>, and <em>Andropogon</em> occur throughout, except
in the moist ravines which are practically meadows. <em>Astragalus</em>,
<em>Psoralea</em>, <em>Erigeron</em>, and <em>Aster</em> grow everywhere on slopes and crests, but
they are much more abundant in certain situations. Other plants, <em>Lomatium</em>,
<em>Meriolix</em>, <em>Anemone</em>, <em>Pentstemon</em>, etc., recur in similar or identical situations
upon different hills. <em>Lomatium</em> alternates between sandy or sandstone crests,
<em>Meriolix</em> and <em>Pentstemon</em> occur together upon dry upper slopes, while <em>Anemone</em>
alternates between dry slopes and crests.</p>

<p class='c007'>Owing to the accidents of migration and competition, similar areas within
a habitat are not occupied by the same species, or group of species. A species
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>found in one area will be replaced in another by a different one of the
same or a different genus. The controlling factors of the area render imperative
an essential identity of vegetation and habitat form, though in systematic
position the plants may be very diverse. Such genera and species may
be termed <em>corresponding</em>. The relation between such plants is essentially
alternation; it should, perhaps, be distinguished from alternation proper as
<em>corresponsive</em>. The prairie formation furnishes a good example of this on
exposed sandy crests, upon which <em>Lomatium</em>, <em>Comandra</em>, and <em>Pentstemon</em>
alternate. Formations exhibit a similar correspondence.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>All species that alternate show a variation in abundance from one area to
another. Frequently, the difference is slight, and may be ignored, except in
determining abundance. Very often, however, the variation is so great that
a facies may be reduced, numerically, to the rank of a principal species, or
one of the latter to a secondary species. This phenomenon is distinguished
as <em>numerical</em> alternation. It arises from the fact that the similar areas are
sufficiently different to affect the abundance, without producing complete
suppression. It is probable that this result is due almost entirely to competition.
<em>Astragalus crassicarpus</em> grows on all the slopes of the prairie formation,
but on some it has the abundance of a facies, while on others it is represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>by a few scattered individuals. This difference is much more striking
in separate examples of the same formation, particularly when a normal
facies is reduced to the numerical value of a secondary species. This is a
matter of great importance in the study of formations, for it has doubtless
often resulted in mistaking a consocies for a formation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alternation furnishes the logical basis for what may be called comparative
phytogeography. The latter is of much broader scope than the old subject
of geographical distribution, for it treats not only of the distribution of formations
and associations as well as of species, but it also seeks to explain
this by means of principles drawn from the relation between habitat and
vegetation. When the latter come to be fully based upon physical factor investigations,
and upon the effects of migration and competition as shown in
alternation, the comparative study of formations will represent the highest
type of phytogeographical activity.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE FORMATION IN DETAIL</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>346. The rank of the formation.</b> There have been as many different
opinions in regard to the application of the term formation as there are concerning
the group which is to be called a species. In taxonomy, however, the
concept of the species is purely arbitrary, and agreement can not be hoped
for. In vegetation, on the contrary, the connection between formation and
habitat is so close that any application of the term to a division greater or
smaller than the habitat is both illogical and unfortunate. As effect and
cause, it is inevitable that the unit of the vegetative covering, the formation,
should correspond to the unit of the earth’s surface, the habitat. This places
the formation upon a basis which can be accurately determined. It is imperative,
however, to have a clear understanding of what constitutes the
difference between habitats. A society is in entire correspondence with the
physical factors of its area, and the same is true of the vegetation of a province.
Nevertheless, many societies usually occur in a single habitat, and a
province contains many habitats. The final test of a habitat is an efficient
difference in one or more of the direct factors, water-content, humidity, and
light, by virtue of which the plant covering differs in structure and in species
from the areas contiguous to it. A balsam-spruce forest shows within
itself certain differences of physical factors and of structure. The water-content
will range from 20–25 per cent, and the light from .02–.003. One
portion may consist chiefly of <em>Pseudotsuga mucronata</em>, another of <em>Picea
engelmannii</em>, and a third of <em>Picea parryana</em>, or these species may be intermingled.
If, however, this forest is compared with the gravel slide, which
touches it on one side, and the meadow thicket, which meets it on another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>the physical factors and the species both demonstrate that it is the forest,
and not its parts, which corresponds to a distinct physical entity, the habitat.
This test of a formation is superfluous in a great many cases, where
the physiognomy of the contiguous areas is conclusive evidence of their
difference. It is evident also that remote regions which are floristically distinct,
such as the prairies and the steppes, may possess areas physically almost
identical and yet be covered by different formations. This point is
further discussed under classification.</p>

<p class='c007'>The existing confusion in the matter of formations is due to two causes.
The first arises from the fact that much ecological work has been hasty.
Little or no attention has been given to development, and in consequence
rudimentary and transitory stages of succession have often been described
as formations. Mixed areas in particular have caused trouble. In the second
place, there has been a marked tendency to minimize the need of thoroughness
and training by calling every slightly different area a formation.
A failure to recognize the primary value of alternation has also contributed
materially to this. Alternating facies, and principal species, when separated
from each other, have often been mistaken for formations. This is a danger
that must be fully appreciated and guarded against. In practically all regions,
the same formation is represented by numerous scattered areas, all
showing greater or less differences arising from alternation. This is especially
true of thickly populated regions where virgin areas are rare. The
fact that twenty-five miles intervene to-day between two small stretches of
primitive prairie is permitted to unduly emphasize their differences. It requires
the study of a number of such examples to counteract this tendency,
and to cause one to see clearly that they must have been at one time merely
so many bits of the prairie formation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection, the lichen and moss groups which are found on rocks
constitute an interesting problem. It is clear that <em>Peltigera</em> and <em>Cladonia</em>,
which grow on the forest floor, and <em>Evernia</em>, <em>Ramalina</em>, and <em>Physcia</em>, which
are found on the trees, are merely constituent species of the forest formation.
The same is true of <em>Cladonia</em>, <em>Urceolaria</em>, and <em>Parmelia</em>, which are
found among the sedges and grasses of alpine meadows. The physical conditions
are essentially those of the formation, and the lichens themselves
are more or less peculiar to it. This is particularly true of the forest, in
which the two strata, bark and moist shaded soil, are present because of the
trees. In the case of granitic rocks, the circumstances are very different.
The species of lichens found on the rocks are not peculiar to the formation,
but they also occur elsewhere. In the forest, <em>Parmelia</em>, <em>Placodium</em>, <em>Physcia</em>,
<em>Rinodina</em>, <em>Urceolaria</em>, <em>Lecanora</em>, <em>Lecidea</em>, etc., occur on the rocks. In the
alpine meadows, the rock groups are composed of <em>Parmelia</em>, <em>Gyrophora</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span><em>Cetraria</em>, <em>Acarospora</em>, <em>Lecanora</em>, <em>Lecidea</em>, <em>Buellia</em>, etc. The stratum itself is
physically very different and constitutes a distinct habitat. These groups
are really small formations, which are quite distinct from the surrounding
forest or meadow. This is proven conclusively in many places in the mountains
where areas of the characteristic lichen formations of cliffs are carried
by the fall of rock fragments into forest and meadow, where they persist
without modification. This also shows clearly that the groups on scattered
rocks in the same area are to be regarded as examples of the same cliff formation,
except where the differences are evidently to be ascribed to development
and not to alternation. Where these rock formations can not be traced
to cliffs or magmata with certainty, they must be considered as antedating
the vegetation in which they occur. Often, indeed, especially in igneous
areas, they are relicts of the initial stage of a primary succession. Finally,
they prove their independence of the forest or meadow formation by initiating
a distinct succession within these. Crustaceous groups or formations
yield to foliose ones, and these in turn give way to formations of mosses,
particularly in the forest where the effect of the diffuse light is felt. From
the above, the following rule of formational limitation is obtained: any area,
which shows an essential difference in physical character, composition, or
development from the surrounding formation is a distinct formation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span><b>347. The parts of a formation.</b> All the parts which make up the structure
of a formation are directly referable to zonation and alternation, alone or
together, or to the interaction of the two. The principles which underlie
this have already been discussed under the phenomena concerned. It is
necessary to point out further that the structure may be produced in several
ways: (1) by zonation alone, (2) by alternation alone, (3) by zonation as
primary and alternation as secondary, (4) by primary alternation and secondary
zonation, (5) by the interaction of the two, as in layered formations.
Though all these methods occur, the first two are relatively rare, and the
resulting structure comparatively imperfect. The typical structure of formations
can best be made clear by the consideration of a prairie which belongs
to the fourth group, and a forest which represents the last.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The major divisions of prairie and forest formations are regularly due to
alternation. There is an inherent tendency to the segregation of facies,
arising out of physical or historical reasons, or from a combination of both.
Not all formations show this, but it is characteristic of the great majority
of them. The primary areas which thus arise have been called associations:
they are naturally subordinate to the formation. To avoid the confusion
which inevitably results from using the word association in two different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>senses, it is proposed to term this primary division of the formation, a <em>consociation</em>,
or better, a <em>consocies</em>. This term is applied only to an area characterized
by a facies, or less frequently, by two or more facies uniformly
commingled. The consocies of grassland are determined by grasses, those
of forests by trees, etc. From the different position of the facies in these
two types of vegetation such areas are readily seen at all times in the forest,
but they are often concealed in grassland by the tall-growing principal species
of the various aspects. When definite consocies are present, they are
often found to mingle where they touch, producing miniature transition
areas, and, very rarely, they sometimes leave gaps in which no facies appears.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The seasonal changes of a formation, which are called aspects, are indicated
by changes in composition or structure, which ordinarily correspond to
the three seasons, spring, summer, and autumn. The latter affect the facies
relatively little, especially those of woody vegetation, but they influence the
principal species profoundly, causing a grouping typical of each aspect.
For these areas controlled by principal species, but changing from aspect to
aspect, the term <em>society</em> is proposed. They are prominent features of the
majority of herbaceous formations, where they are often more striking than
the facies. In forests, they occur in the shrubby and herbaceous layers, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>are consequently much less conspicuous than the facies. A close inspection
of the societies formed by principal species shows that they are far from
uniform. Since they usually fail to exhibit distinct parts, it becomes necessary
to approach the question of their structure from a new standpoint.
Such is afforded by aggregation, which yields the simplest group in vegetation,
i. e., that of parent and offspring. This is so exactly a family in the
ordinary sense that there seems to be ample warrant for violating a canon of
terminology by using the word for this group, in spite of its very different
application in taxonomy. It has already been shown that aggregation further
produces a grouping of families, which may properly be called a <em>community</em>.
As they are used here, <em>family</em> and <em>community</em> become equally applicable
to the association of plants, animals, or man. Both families and
communities occur regularly in each society of the formation, and they represent
its two structures. In some cases, all the families are grouped in communities,
two or more of which then form the society. Very frequently,
however, families occur singly, without reference to a community, and the
two then constitute independent parts of the same area. This is typically
the case wherever gregarious species are present, since these are merely
family groups produced by aggregation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Objection may be made that this analysis of formational structure has
been carried too far, and that some of the structures recognized are mere
interpretations, and not actual facts. Such a criticism will not come from
one who has got beyond the superficial study of formations, for he will at
once recognize that certain probable features of structure have not been considered.
On the other hand, the ecologist or the botanist who has not made
a careful investigation from the standpoints of development and structure
will naturally refrain from expressing an opinion, until he has obtained an
acquaintance at first hand with the facts. Over-refinement is the usual penalty
of intensive work. The unbiased investigator, however, will not be misled
by the suddenness with which new concepts appear. It seems plausible
that the structure of a formation, if not as definite, is at least nearly as complex
as that of an individual plant. Few botanists will insist that the refinement
of tissues and tissue systems has been carried further than the
differentiation of the plant warrants. Yet, if these had been defined within
a period of a few years rather than slowly recognized during more than a
century, they would have been called seriously in question. As a matter of
fact, the consocies, under the term association, and the society, under various
names, have been recognized by ecologists for several years. They are definite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>phenomena of alternation which can be found anywhere. The family
and the community, though the latter is less distinct in outline, are equally
valid structures, the proof of which anyone can obtain by thorough methods
of study.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>348. Nomenclature of the divisions.</b> The suffix <em>-etum</em> is used to designate
a consocies of a formation, e. g., <em>Picetum</em>, <em>Caricetum</em>, etc. When two or
more species characterize the area, the most important, or more rarely, the
two are used. The termination used to designate a society is <em>-ile</em>, as <em>Asterile</em>,
<em>Sedile</em>, <em>Rosile</em>. The suffix which denotes the community is <em>-are</em>, and for the
family, it is <em>-on</em>, viz., <em>Giliare</em>, <em>Bromare</em>, <em>Bidenton</em>, <em>Helianthon</em>, etc. Layers
are indicated by the affix <em>-anum</em>, as <em>Opulasteranum</em>, <em>Verbesina-Rudbeckianum</em>,
etc. It is evident that these suffixes, like the terms to which they refer,
must be used always for the proper divisions if they are to have any
value at all. There has been a marked tendency, for example, to use <em>-etum</em>
in connection with the names of groups of very different rank. It is hardly
necessary to point out that such a practice does not promote clearness. The
following tabular statement will illustrate the application of both terms and
suffixes:</p>

<p class='c007'><b>349. The investigation of a particular formation.</b> A comprehensive and
thorough study of a formation should be based upon as many examples of it
as are accessible. The example which is at once the most typical and the
most accessible is made the base area. This plan saves time and energy, reduces
the number of instruments that are absolutely necessary, and establishes
a common basis for comparison. The inquiry should be made along
four lines, all fundamental to a proper knowledge of the formation. These
lines are: (1) the determination of the factors of the habitat, (2) a quadrat
and a transect study of the structure of the formation, (3) a similar investigation
of development, (4) a floristic study of the contiguous formation,
with special reference to migration. The sequence indicated has proven to
be the most satisfactory, and is to be regarded as all but absolutely essential.

<h3 class='c015'>CLASSIFICATION AND RELATIONSHIP</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>350. Bases.</b> Formations may be grouped with reference to habitat or
kind, development or position. Classification upon the basis of habitat
places together formations which are similar in physiognomy and structure.
Developmental classification is based upon the fact that the stages of a particular
succession are organically connected or related, though they are normally
different in both physiognomy and structure. Grouping with respect
to position is made solely upon occurrence in the same division of vegetation.
The formations thus brought together usually possess neither similarity
of kind or structure, nor do they have any necessary developmental connection.
Habitat and developmental classification are of fundamental value;
regional arrangement is more superficial in character. All serve, however,
to emphasize different relations, and, while the developmental system expresses
the most, they should all be used to exhibit the vegetation of a region,
province, or zone.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>351. Habitat classification.</b> In arranging formations with reference to
habitats, the direct factors, water and light, can alone be used to advantage.
Such a system is fundamental, because it is founded upon similarity of habitat
and of structure. Proposed groupings based upon nutrition-content, or
upon the division of factors into climatic and edaphic, have elsewhere<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c017'><sup>[42]</sup></a> been
shown to be altogether of secondary importance, if not actually erroneous.
The basis of the habitat grouping is water-content, which is supplemented
by light whenever the factor is decisive. The primary divisions thus obtained
are water, forest, grassland, and desert, which are characterized respectively
by associations of hydrophytes, mesophytes, hylophytes, poophytes,
and xerophytes respectively. Within these, formations are arranged according
to the type of habitat, i. e., pond, meadow, forest, dune, etc. These
divisions comprise all formations which belong to the type by virtue of their
physiognomy and structure. Such formations differ from each other very
considerably or completely in the matter of floristic, i. e., component species,
but they still belong to the same type. A dune formation in the interior and
one on the coast may not have a single species in common, and yet they are
essentially alike in habitat, development, and structure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Particular formations are indicated by means of floristic distinctions.
Thus, <em>Populus-hylium</em> is the aspen forest as distinguished from the <em>Picea-Pseudotsuga-hylium</em>,
or the balsam-spruce forest; and the <em>Bulbilis-psilium</em>,
or buffalo-grass prairie, from the <em>Bouteloua-Andropogon-psilium</em>, or grama-bluestem
prairie. Similarly, the aspen formation of the Old World and of
the New may be distinguished as <em>Populus-tremula-hylium</em> and <em>Populus-tremuloides-hylium</em>,
respectively. In all formational names, the facies alone
should be used. Frequently, a single facies will suffice for clearness. As a
rule, however, the two most important facies should be employed; in rare
cases only is it necessary to use the names of three. When it is desirable to
refer to two or more examples of the same formation, a geographical term is
added, e. g., (1) <em>Populus-hylium</em> (<em>Crystal Park</em>), (2) <em>Populus-hylium</em>
(<em>Cabin Canyon</em>).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>353. Developmental classification.</b> This is based upon succession as the
record of development. Upon the basis of development, all the formations
which belong to the same succession are classed together. They are arranged
within each group in the sequence found in the particular succession.
From its nature, developmental classification is of primary importance in
exhibiting the history of vegetational changes. It has less value than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>habitat system for summarizing the essential structure of a vegetation, inasmuch
as it places the emphasis upon historical rather than structural features.
It is evident that both deal with the same formations, and that the
difference is merely one of viewpoint. The habitat classification is simpler
in that it considers only those formations actually on the ground, while development
has regularly to take into account stages which have disappeared.
The groups of the developmental system, and the arrangement of formations
within them have already been indicated under the nomenclature of succession
(sections 326 and 327).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>354. Regional classification.</b> The grouping of formations with respect
to the divisions of vegetations is chiefly of geographical value. It indicates a
certain general relationship, but its principal use is to summarize the structure
of the vegetative covering of a region. The arrangement of formations
in the various divisions is made with reference to the outline of North
American vegetation (section 341). This is naturally based upon the identity
of altitude and latitude zones. In the study of mountain countries, it is
often desirable to group formations with reference to altitude alone. In
this case, the grouping is based upon the following divisions: (1) <em>bathyphytia</em>,
lowland plant formations; (2) <em>mesiophytia</em>, midland formations;
(3) <em>pediophytia</em>, upland formations; (4) <em>pagophytia</em>, foot-hill formations;
(5) <em>orophytia</em>, subalpine formations; (6) <em>acrophytia</em>, alpine formations;
(7) <em>chionophytia</em>, niveal formations.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>355. Mixed formations.</b> These are mixtures of two, rarely more, adjacent
formations, or of two consecutive stages of the same succession. Mixed
formations are really transitions in space or in time between two distinct
formations. Theoretically, they are to be referred to one or the other, according
to the preponderance of species. Actually, however, they often
persist in an intermediate condition for many years, and it becomes necessary
to devote considerable attention to them. In some cases, there is good reason
to think that the species of two contiguous formations have become permanently
associated, and thus constitute a new formation. This is often
apparently true in succession, when the change from one stage to the next
requires a long term of years, but it is really true only of the very rare cases
in which a succession becomes stabilized in a transition stage. When the
mixture is due to development, the formations concerned are often quite dissimilar,
e. g., grassland and thicket, thicket and forest. If it is the result of
position, the formations are usually similar, i. e., both are grassland, thicket,
or forest, since the plants of the lower level are regularly assimilated or destroyed,
when invasion occurs at two levels. The term <em>mictium</em> (μικτόν,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>mixture) is here proposed for the designation of all mixed formations,
whether they arise from succession or from juxtaposition. Thus, the <em>Mentzelia-Elymus-mictium</em>
is the transition between the <em>Mentzelia-Pseudocymopterus-chalicium</em>
and the <em>Elymus-Muhlenbergia-chalicium</em>. Similarly, the
<em>Populus-Picea-mictium</em> and the <em>Pinus-Pseudotsuga-mictium</em> are transition
stages in the development of the <em>Picea-hylium</em>. On the other hand, the <em>Andropogon-Bulbilis-mictium</em>
is a mixture produced by the mingling of two
contiguous prairie formations. In the future development of this subject, it
will probably become desirable to name mixed formations on the basis of
origin, but at present this is unnecessary. Both in classification and in description
they should be considered between the formations which give rise
to them, and this will at once indicate their origin.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Puzzling cases of mixture resulting from position occur toward the limits
of facies which occupy extensive areas. <em>Bouteloua oligostachya</em>, and <em>Andropogon
scoparius</em> extend from the prairies through the sand-hills and plains,
and into the foot-hills of the Rocky mountains. Their abundance at once
raises a question as to the validity of the prairie, sand-hill, plain, and foot-hill
formations. If these two grasses were controlling, and equally characteristic
throughout, then the entire stretch would have to be regarded as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>single formation. Since they are often absent, or mixed with other facies of
greater importance, they can not be considered the sole tests of the formation.
This view is reinforced by the fact that prairie, sand-hill, plains, and
foot-hill all have their characteristic principal and secondary species, in addition
to facies that are more or less typical. In certain formations, doubtless,
<em>Bouteloua</em> and <em>Andropogon</em> are relicts, in others invaders, while in the
formations actually constituted by them they are dominant. The final solution
of such problems is quite impossible, however, until the comparative
study of large areas can be based upon the accurate detailed investigation of
the component formations.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>Experimental Vegetation</span></h3>

<p class='c016'><b>356. Scope and methods.</b> The experimental study of the formation as a
complex organism rests upon methods essentially similar to those discussed
under experimental evolution. The scope of the two fields is practically the
same, moreover, in that both deal with the experimental development of an
organism and the structures that result. The actual problems are naturally
very different, since the formation is a complex of individual plants, but the
fundamental basis of habitat, function, and structure is common to both.
However, the functions now to be considered are aggregation, invasion, competition,
etc., and the structures, zones, consocies, societies, communities, and
families. The latter may properly be regarded as adaptations called forth
by the adjustment, i. e., aggregation, migration, ecesis, etc., of the formation
to the physical factors of the habitat. As consequences of measured factors,
formational adjustment and adaptation must themselves be carefully measured
and recorded. For these purposes, the methods of quadrat and transect,
of chart, photograph, and formation herbarium are used. Invaluable
as they are for any scientific inquiry into vegetation, such methods form the
very foundation of experimental study in which accuracy is the first
desideratum.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has already been shown that nature’s own experiments in the production
of new forms furnish the best material for experimental evolution. This
statement is equally true of experimental vegetation. The formation of new
habitats by weathering and transport, and the denuding of old ones, yield
experimental plots of the greatest value. This is likewise the case in the
great majority of formations, where invasion or competition is active. These
are the phenomena that must be considered in any careful study of vegetation,
but in taking them up from the experimental standpoint, greater attention
must be paid to detail, and the changes must be followed closely for a
longer time. The method that makes use of existing changes in vegetation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>is designated the <em>method of natural habitats</em>. In contrast with this is the
<em>method of artificial habitats</em>, in which the habitat itself is definitely modified,
or a group of species actually transferred to a different habitat. Many problems
of vegetation can be attacked with greater success under control than
in the field. This is particularly true of competition, in which results can be
obtained most readily by means of the <em>method of control habitats</em>, as carried
on in the plant house.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>METHOD OF NATURAL HABITATS</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>357. Natural experiments.</b> Every family as well as every community
constitutes an experiment in competition; the same statement necessarily
holds for the larger groups, society, consocies, and formation, which are composed
of families and communities. The last also make it possible to study
competition in two typical instances, viz., in the family, where the individuals
are of one kind, and in the community, where they belong to two or more
different species. The community, moreover, is a product of invasion, and it
furnishes material for the study of this function, as well as for that of aggregation
and competition. Practically every formation shows some invasion,
but as a rule stable formations contain so few invaders that they are relatively
unimportant in this connection. Invasion is most active in transition
areas and in mixed formations, whether produced by juxtaposition or by
succession, and its study in these places yields by far the largest number of
valuable results.</p>

<p class='c007'>As typical complete invasion, a succession is the best of all natural experiments
in aggregation, migration, ecesis, and competition. This is especially
true of the initial stages in which changes in the number and position
are most readily followed. The methods used in studying successions have
been given elsewhere. In addition, it should be pointed out that one of the
first tasks in taking up the ecological investigation of a region is to make a
careful search for all new and denuded areas, as well as for those in which
succession is taking place. The phenomena in these areas can not be explained
until the habitats and formations have been worked over critically,
but the facts must be collected at the earliest possible moment, since the
stages of the succession are constantly changing, while the stable formations
are not.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>METHOD OF ARTIFICIAL HABITATS</h3>

<p class='c016'><b>358. Modification of habitat.</b> As the final factors in ecesis and competition,
water, light, and temperature control the grouping of plants into vegetation.
An efficient change in one of these, or in all of them, brings about a
visible adjustment in the structure of the plant group concerned. Modifications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>of water-content and light are readily produced in the field by drainage,
irrigation, shading, clearing, etc. In fact, all the changes of habitat
indicated under experimental evolution serve equally well to initiate experiments
in experimental vegetation; indeed, the same experiment covers both
fields. It is impracticable, however, to modify the temperature of a habitat
without changing its water-content or light, and consequently the influence
of temperature can not be determined through experiment by modification.
The extent of the area modified should be as large as convenience will permit,
in order that the number of individuals may be large enough to indicate
clearly the resulting adjustment in position and arrangement. The best results
can be obtained where a small separate area of a formation can be
modified, e. g., where a small swamp can be drained, or a depression flooded.
In the case of light, however, it is usually impossible to clear or to shade a
large area, and the study must be restricted to a relatively small group of
plants. In regions where lumbering is actively carried on, the consequent
clearing initiates invaluable experiments over large areas, and this is likewise
true of forest plantations. Modification of a large area has decided advantages
in bringing out the changes in the more prominent structural features,
but the causes and the details of the adjustment can be worked out
much more satisfactorily in a small area.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>359. Denuding.</b> The modification of the habitat by denuding is the sole
method of initiating succession by experiment. It is consequently of the
most fundamental importance in investigating aggregation, ecesis, and competition,
as well as the reactions exerted by the invaders of the different
stages. The possibilities of denuding an entire habitat or an extensive
area are not great, and the investigator must content himself with denuded
quadrats, transects, and migration circles, which are small enough to permit
a critical study of all the factors in succession. It is of course unnecessary
that the denuding be done by the ecologist himself, provided he is able
to follow the succession from the very beginning. Accordingly, it becomes
possible for him to make the very best use of all those changes wrought
by man in which the vegetation is destroyed over considerable areas. These
are essentially natural experiments, and at this point the methods of natural
and artificial habitats merge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manner of denuding depends in a degree upon the nature of vegetation,
but, when time, convenience, and safety are all taken into account,
the actual removal of the vegetation as indicated under the denuded quadrat
is by far the most satisfactory. Under certain conditions, flooding or burning
can be used to advantage, but cases of this kind are infrequent. The
purpose of the experiment determines the kind of area to be denuded.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Quadrat, transact, and migration circle are equally valuable for ecesis and
competition. The quadrat is best adapted to work in a homogeneous area,
while the transect is suited to a heterogeneous one characterized by zones,
societies, or communities. It is an advantage to replace the denuded transect
by a series of denuded quadrats, one for each zone or society, when the
transect would be too long for convenience. The denuded migration circle
is invaluable for aggregation and ecesis, since it makes possible the study
of migration as a distinct function. A series of denuded quadrats, consisting
of one or more in the different stages of a succession, furnishes
important evidence concerning the development of each stage. By far the
best method, however, for making a comparative study of the stages of a
succession is the quadrat sequence. A quadrat is denuded each year, thus
yielding a complete sequence of miniature stages through the whole course
of succession. This method is especially valuable when a succession is
represented by a single example, and there is no opportunity of reconstructing
it by the comparison of various stages. A quadrat sequence is naturally
of the greatest value if begun at the time when the first invaders appear.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>360. Modification of the formation by transfer.</b> The study of partial
and intermittent invasion into an established vegetation is made through
the transfer of a species or group of species by means of seeding or planting.
The process differs in no way from that described for experimental
evolution, except in so far that an endeavor is made to establish a family or
a community, and not merely a few individuals. Transfer makes possible
the critical investigation of ecesis under conditions of intense competition,
as well as the study of aggregation and the origin of plant groups under these
conditions. Perhaps its greatest value is in the experimental study of alternation
and zonation, especially the former. It is practically impossible
to determine whether alternation, especially when corresponsive, is due to
physical or historical causes, i. e., migration and competition, except by
means of the reciprocal transfer of the species concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Field cultures for the careful study of ecesis and competition are made by
transferring seeds or plants to new or denuded soils. This is practically
a combination of the methods of modification and transfer. It has a unique
value in making it possible to initiate artificial successions of almost any
character that is desired, and to carry them out with the reactions more or
less under control. This opens up an extremely important field of experimental
inquiry, which promises to put the study of succession upon a
much more exact basis. Competition cultures in the field are not essentially
different from those under control, and they will be considered under the
next method.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>361. Competition cultures.</b> Although it is quite possible to carry on
experiments in invasion and succession in the planthouse, the limited space
usually available makes this undesirable, except in a few problems where
control is necessary. Competition cultures, on the other hand, yield better
results in the planthouse than in the field, since the physical factors and the
appearance of unwelcome migrants are much more easily controlled. The
possibilities of the culture method in the study of competition seem inexhaustible,
and the author has found it necessary to confine his own investigations
to a few of the fundamental problems. In this work, he has
distinguished several kinds of cultures, based chiefly upon the species concerned
and the arrangement of the individuals. <em>Simple</em> cultures are those
in which a single species is used. The resulting group is a family, and the
competition is between like individuals. In such cultures, the problem of
the factors in competition is reduced to its simplest terms. <em>Mixed</em> cultures
are based upon two or more species, and the problem is correspondingly
complicated. As a rule, all the seeds have been sown at the same time in
both simple and mixed cultures, but it has been found desirable to make
some <em>heterochronous</em> cultures, in which seeds are also sown after the plants
have appeared. Mixed cultures are distinguished as <em>layered</em> cultures, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>the species are of very different height. Thus, rosettes have been grown
with stemmed plants, tall slender forms with low branching ones, erect plants
with twining and climbing plants, etc. Further evidence as to the nature
of competition has been sought by means of <em>ecad</em> cultures, and <em>factor</em> cultures.
In the former, plants of different response to water and light are
grown together under the same conditions, in order to evaluate the part
played by the nature of the plant. In a factor culture, the area is divided
into two or more parts which are given different amounts of water or of light,
in order to determine the influence of slight variations upon the same competitors.
In somewhat similar fashion, an attempt has been made to
ascertain the bearing of biotic factors upon competition. Cultures are
easily made in which <em>Cuscuta</em> or parasitic fungi are used to place certain
species at a disadvantage. <em>Permanent</em> cultures are obtained by allowing the
plants to ripen and drop their seeds for several generations, just as in
nature. They are indispensable for determining the final outcome of the
competition between different species.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>362. Details of culture methods.</b> All competition cultures have been
made 1 meter square. In other words, they are quadrats, and they are
treated exactly as denuded quadrats in the field with respect to factor
readings, charts, and photographs. In the writer’s studies, germination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>tests were made of a large number of species, and those selected which
showed a high per cent of germinability. Since this was the first experimental
study of competition, this test was deemed necessary, but it is quite
evident that no such selection is made in nature. Consequently, when the
seeds used are known to be fresh, a germination test is usually superfluous.
Considerable care was taken also to select species known to be vigorous
growers, with the result that practically all the species used for experiment
were ruderal or subruderal. The species employed, and the kinds of cultures
in which they were grouped were as follows:</p>

<p>Fig. 85. Heterochronous culture of <em>Helianthus annuus</em> and <em>Datura stramonium</em>. Family culture of <em>Datura</em>, <em>Verbascum</em>, etc., in the foreground.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>1. <em>Simple culture of Helianthus annuus.</em> The culture plot was divided
into four equal parts; 12 seeds were planted in one, 25 in another, 50 in the
third, and 100 in the fourth.</p>

<p class='c038'>2. <em>Mixed culture of Helianthus annuus, Panicum virgatum, and Elymus
canadensis.</em> Twenty-five seeds each of <em>Helianthus</em> and <em>Panicum</em> were
planted alternately at equal distances in one-half of the plot, while the other
half was planted similarly with <em>Helianthus</em> and <em>Elymus</em>.</p>

<p class='c038'>3. <em>Mixed culture of Solidago rigida and Onagra biennis.</em> Over one-half
of the plot were scattered 50 seeds of <em>Solidago</em> and 100 of <em>Onagra</em>; over
the other, 100 and 200 seeds respectively.</p>

<p class='c038'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>4. <em>Layered culture of Laciniaria punctata, Bidens frondosa, Salvia pitcheri,
Cassia chamaecrista and Kuhnia glutinosa.</em> Fifty seeds of each species
were scattered more or less uniformly over the entire plot.</p>

<p class='c038'>5. <em>Layered culture of Silphium laciniatum, Datura stramonium and Lactuca
ludoviciana.</em> Fifty seeds of <em>Datura</em> and <em>Lactuca</em>, and 25 of <em>Silphium</em>
were sown uniformly in one-half of the plot. In the other half, 25 holes were
made at equal intervals, and one seed of each of the three planted in each
hole.</p>

<p class='c038'>6. <em>Ecad culture of Oenothera rhombipetala (xerophytic), Verbascum
thapsus (mesophytic), and Penthorum sedoides (hydrophytic).</em> One hundred
seeds of <em>Oenothera</em> and 200 each of <em>Verbascum</em> and <em>Penthorum</em> were
scattered over the plot.</p>

<p class='c038'>7. <em>Heterochronous culture of Helianthus annuus and Datura stramonium.</em>
One hundred seeds of Helianthus were scattered over one half, and the
same number of Datura seeds over the other half of the plot. In both,
also, 50 seeds were sown in one 4–inch circle, and 25 seeds in a second circle
at some distance. A month later, 100 seeds of <em>Helianthus</em> were sown in
the <em>Datura</em> plot, and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p class='c038'>8. <em>Family culture of Helianthus, Kuhnia, Panicum, Bidens, Onagra,
Datura, Penthorum, Solidago and Verbascum.</em> The plot was divided into
9 squares and in each were sown 50 seeds of one of these plants.</p>

<p class='c038'>9. <em>Community culture.</em> The sowing was made exactly as for the family
culture, except that 20 seeds of each plant were used. In the middle of
each square, 5 seeds of a different species were planted. For the <em>Helianthus</em>,
<em>Kuhnia</em>, and <em>Panicum</em> groups, <em>Onagra</em> was used; for <em>Bidens</em>, <em>Onagra</em>,
and <em>Datura</em>, <em>Helianthus</em> was used, and for <em>Penthorum</em>, <em>Solidago</em>, and <em>Verbascum</em>,
<em>Panicum</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the time the cultures were started, check plants were sown in pots.
The most vigorous seedlings were transplanted singly to large pots, and
grown under conditions of water, light, and soil as similar as possible to
those of the competition plots. Photographs of check plants and plots were
made at the proper intervals, and the plots were charted in quadrats to show
the course of competition. The factors which control competition were
sought in a critical study of water-content and light values, which is still
in process. This work has gone far enough to indicate the correctness of the
view<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c017'><sup>[45]</sup></a> that competition is purely physical in character. It has, moreover,
been demonstrated that “room” in competition is merely a loose expression
for the relation between the number of individuals in a given space, and the
amount of water, light, and temperature available in the same space.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r37'>37</a>. When this word was first proposed, the author did not know that Briquet had already
applied the term <em>polytopism</em> to this concept (Ann. Conserv. Bot. Gen., 5:73.
1901). Since polygenesis expresses the idea of origin, and applies to multiple origin
in time as well as in space, it is retained as the name of this concept. Polytopic and
monotopic are adopted for multiple and single origin in space respectively, and <em>polychronic</em>
and <em>monochronic</em> are proposed for similar origin in time.</p>
